Brush Research embraced the benefits of a plateau finish and pioneered the concept of plateau honing culminating in the introduction of the Flex-Hone tool in 1972. The Flex-Hone has gained many nicknames over the years and including ball hone, ball style hone, flexihone, dingleberry hone, bead brush, glaze breaker and glaze buster. Flexible honing with the Flex-Hone tool produces an oil holding cross hatch pattern and a true plateau finish free of cut, torn and folded metal. Any type or size of cylinder can benefit from the Flex-Hone. These abrasive bead style brushes are produced in standard diameters from 4mm to 36 inches. Nine abrasive types are offered including silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, boron carbide and diamond allowing the tool to be tailored to finish any base material. A choice of 11 different grit selections are available for precise control of finish parameters. The elimination of peaks results in rapid ring seating, better oil control, reduced seepage in hydraulic and pneumatic applications and provides better seal performance and longer seal life. Successful applications include firearm chambers, shotgun barrels, musical instruments, combustion chambers, air compressors, pumps, valve bodies, valve guides, brake cylinders, wheel cylinders and the list goes on and on. Flex-Hone tools are also very effective for deburring cross drilled holes, port radiusing and edge blending. Because of its unique construction, the Flex-Hone is self-centering, self-aligning, and self-compensating for wear so it does not require an elaborate set-up or special training. Deburring can be effectively automated and combined in the machining process to allow a complete cylinder finish in one operation or it can be employed as a secondary operation with equal results.']",

With the Digital Planer Height Gauge simply lower your planer until the gauge reads .565 - 9/16. It can\\'t get any easier! Unique gauge reads out both decimal and fractional measurements. Fits most portable \"lunch box\" style planers. Easy to follow installation instructions.', 'This precision gauge has an angled display for easy viewing as well as \"auto shut off.\" And it fits most portable woodworking planers. It easily mounts to Dewalt, Delta, Ridgid, Ryobi, Makita, Craftsman, and others. It mounts in minutes and is calibrated in seconds. It displays the thickness of the wood coming out the back of the planer in inches with fractions or millimeters. It is easy to attach the WR510 to your portable planer. It comes with simple mounting brackets and detailed instructions that allow you to mount this on many models without even drilling a single hole. Calibration takes only seconds with its patented calibration system. The WR510 uses a piece of freshly planed board to ensure the readout displays the exact thickness of wood coming out the back of your planer. The large easy to read display reads in inches with fractions or millimeters. The fractions are displayed using Precise Fraction Technology which gives you 4 times the accuracy of other fraction readouts. The decimal inches are displayed in .005-inch increments, the fractions in 1/32-inch, and the millimeters in .1mm increments. Accuracy is .0025 decimal inches, 1/500 fraction inches, and .05mm metric. Once it is set up and calibrated, the WR510 consistently displays the thickness of wood coming out the back of your planer. It never needs re-calibrated unless the battery is replaced or the blades get worn down. Advanced features let you zero the blade, remove a precise amount of material, or measure the thickness of any board.']",

The tubing is welded and drawn for a smoother bore than non-drawn welded tubing and a more consistent wall thickness than seamless tubing. It has greater corrosion resistance than 302 stainless steel and is annealed to restore formability for bending or flaring. This welded and drawn round tubing meets American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) A269 specifications for quality assurance and is suitable for use in applications such as transporting beer, wine, and milk.', 'Metal tubing, also called fractional tubing, is used to transfer liquids, air, or solids, and it is characterized by a round shape and a hollow center. Metal tubing is commonly made with various grades of austenitic stainless steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and titanium materials and their alloys. Construction types include seamless, welded, or welded and drawn. Seamless tubing has no seam or weld point, which enables it to better withstand high pressure and resist corrosion. Welded tubing, made by rolling and welding metal sheet stock, is weaker than and not as rounded as seamless tubing, but it has a more consistent wall thickness for tighter wall tolerances. Welded and drawn tubing, also known as \"drawn over mandrel\" (DOM), is typically welded tubing that is drawn through a die and over a mandrel to create a smooth inner diameter, which gives the tubing comparable corrosion resistance to seamless tubing while still offering welded tubing\\'s tighter wall tolerances. Compression, vacuum, sanitary, and flared fittings connect tubing or redirect flow in a fluid handling system. Metal tubing is used in HVAC and plumbing systems and for applications in the aerospace, automotive, chemical processing, food and beverage, manufacturing, and medical industries.']",

The water activated polyurethane formula expands into materials to form an incredibly strong bond to virtually anything. Gorilla Glue is a 100% waterproof glue, safe for indoor and outdoor use and strong enough to stand up to the elements. Gorilla Glues your solution for almost any project or repair. Sand it, paint it, stain it. Simply stated, its the Toughest Glue on Planet Earth. Directions: 1.Prepare and Dampen the Surfaces: All surfaces must be clean, dust free and tight fitting. For shiny surfaces, such as metals, glass and some plastics, roughen up the material to give the glue something to bite into. Lightly dampen one surface with water. We recommend using a damp cloth or spraying with water. Do not saturate the surface. For dense hardwoods, lightly dampen both surfaces prior to gluing. 2. Evenly Apply Gorilla Glue Onto the Dry Surface. Carefully apply onto the dry surface. Do not over apply. We recommend wearing gloves or spreading the glue with a disposable brush. 3. Clamp the Two Surfaces Together Tightly. Make sure the clamping pressure is distributed evenly across the surface. Or, if you dont have a clamp, use heavy objects or Gorilla Tape to achieve the appropriate clamping pressure. Clamp objects for 12 hours. For best results, allow 24 hours to cure. 4. Clean up: If you need to remove any uncured squeeze out or wet glue, we recommend wiping with a dry cloth or using a standard paint thinner. Once the glue is dry, it is best removed mechanically: Try sanding, chiseling, scraping or picking. 5. Storage Tips: After each use, wipe the bottles lid and nozzle clean with a dry cloth. While still squeezing, tightly replace the cap and then store in a cool, dry place. You should expect a year shelf life.

    "description": "[\"Gorilla tape has taken duct tape to a new level. This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, its the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates Rough surfaces. It sticks to Rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: the toughest on planet earth. Directions: use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla tape! to retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess Supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla tape works best at temperatures above 32f (0c). for best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla tape freezes, it will work just fine Once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue.

The 110 copper alloy is 99.9% pure copper and has high conductivity and formability. The material has an H04 temper, meaning it has been cold worked to a hard temper.', 'Copper, brass, and bronze are known as red metals because they contain copper, which has a reddish color. Copper, a term that applies to alloys containing at least 99.3% copper, offers very high thermal and electrical conductivity and provides corrosion resistance, formability, and machinability. Brass is an alloy of copper and varying levels of zinc, sometimes with additional elements. It provides greater strength and better machinability than copper or bronze. Bronze is commonly an alloy of copper and tin, but sometimes it is copper alloyed with other elements such as aluminum, phosphorus, manganese, or silicon. Tin gives bronze more corrosion resistance than brass and greater strength than copper. Copper and its alloys have temper designations, meaning the material has undergone a process to achieve certain properties of strength and hardness.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the material's overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Formability indicates how easily the material can be permanently shaped. Machinability describes how easily it can be cut, shaped, finished, or otherwise machined, while weldability characterizes the ability to be welded.\"]",

This tape hand tears, resists sticking to itself and adheres to a variety of surfaces, making it super easy to use on the job. Let your repairs fly under the radar without sacrificing performance with 3M TRANSPARENT Duct Tape.\", 'It\\'s not often the word revolutionary can be associated with duct tape, that old, sticky standby used in plumbing repairs, hockey stick augmentation, and homeland security protection. By getting the gray out--and avoiding the \"sore thumb\" look of typical duct tape repairs--3M\\'s Scotch Transparent Duct Tape can indeed lay claim to a revolution of the toolbox. But seeing through it is just the start. This duct tape can be easily torn by hand, is UV resistant, and, through accelerated weathering tests, has been shown to last six times longer than its old-school namesake.', 'Duct tape has been around since 1942 when the military needed a waterproof tape for sealing ammunition boxes. Originally colored green, it was referred to as \"duck tape\" due to its moisture resistance as well as its cotton duck construction--the same ribbed cloth used in bandages. After the war, it was adopted by contractors working in the booming housing industry, where it got its \"duct\" name for easily connecting heating and air conditioning ducts.', \"History's fine, but what can 3M's new, clear duct tape do for us? Virtually anything. First, we noticed its powerful stickiness--the roll itself adheres to just about any surface when laid on its side. As advertised, the tape was easily torn from the roll by hand with minimal force. 3M also seems to have ironed out one of the biggest complaints about duct tape: wrinkles. In our testing, we applied it repeatedly and evenly without the tape sticking to itself and without creating odd bumps and creases. And while the tape is rather sticky, it doesn't go overboard, easily lifting off surfaces when we needed it to and not leaving the tacky, viscous residue often found with other duct tapes.\", 'As for its transparency, the tape blended well into just about any surface we applied it to. It was never \"invisible\" but did have the chameleon-like quality of reflecting the surface beneath it and only calling attention to itself when caught in direct light. Also, we placed bands of the tape over our computer monitor before writing this review (don\\'t try this at home, kids). Peering through the fabric ribs was a nuisance, but we were able to compose the description you\\'re now reading. How\\'s that for transparency?', \"Our only complaint is that, as with most transparent tapes, finding where to start peeling the roll can be difficult. While this certainly isn't a showstopper, we did find a solution: mounting the roll onto a tape gun.\", \"Tape, by its nature, is not a terribly exciting product (or topic). But 3M's Scotch Transparent Duct Tape is truly a tipping-point entrant, one that may someday become ubiquitous and banish gray duct tape to the nether reaches of our tool sheds, and memories. --Agen G.N. Schmitz\", 'Pros: Transparent, easily blends into the surface background Easily torn from the roll with minimal force Sticky, but not too sticky Adheres smoothly without wrinkles or creases Cons: So transparent that finding where to start peeling the roll can be difficult ']",

    "description": "['', 'The 304 stainless steel sheet has a #4 brushed finish, has been annealed, meets American Society for Testing and Materials International ASTM A240 and American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME SA240 specifications, and has a standard tolerance. The 304 stainless steel grade is a general-purpose material that combines corrosion resistance, weldability, and formability, making it the most commonly used grade of stainless steel. An austenitic stainless steel that is one of the 18-8 grades, 304 can be cold worked to increase its hardness and strength while maintaining most of its formability. The material is typically nonmagentic but may become slightly magnetic when cold worked. The #4 brushed finish has a moderately reflective appearance with fine parallel polishing lines. The material has been annealed, a method of heating and cooling metal to modify its properties, such as increasing its formability and toughness or decreasing its strength, after it has been shaped.', 'Stainless steel is an iron alloy with resistance to staining and rusting in many environments where steel would typically degrade. The chemical composition of each grade creates a grain structure that falls into one of five classes: austenitic, duplex, ferritic, martensitic, and precipitation hardening. The austenitic class contains the most formable, weldable, and corrosion-resistant stainless steel grades, but they cannot be heat treated. The duplex class offers high resistance to pitting and chloride stress corrosion cracking. Duplex grades are heat treatable and roughly twice as strong as austenitic grades. The ferritic class contains moderately formable and corrosion-resistant grades compared to other stainless steel classes, but they cannot be heat treated. The martensitic class includes some of the hardest and strongest stainless steel grades that also offer mild corrosion resistance, high hardness, and good formability. Martensitic grades can be heat treated. The precipitation-hardening (PH) class can be heat treated after fabrication to achieve some of the highest hardness ratings in stainless steel.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Formability indicates how easily the material can be permanently shaped. Machinability describes how easily it can be cut, shaped, finished, or otherwise machined, while weldability characterizes the ability to be welded. Magnetism characterizes how much the material is repelled by or attracted to a magnet.\"]",

The water activated polyurethane formula expands into materials to form an incredibly strong bond to virtually anything. Gorilla Glue is a 100% waterproof glue, safe for indoor and outdoor use and strong enough to stand up to the elements. Gorilla Glues your solution for almost any project or repair. Sand it, paint it, stain it. Simply stated, its the Toughest Glue on Planet Earth. Directions: 1.Prepare and Dampen the Surfaces: All surfaces must be clean, dust free and tight fitting. For shiny surfaces, such as metals, glass and some plastics, roughen up the material to give the glue something to bite into. Lightly dampen one surface with water. We recommend using a damp cloth or spraying with water. Do not saturate the surface. For dense hardwoods, lightly dampen both surfaces prior to gluing. 2. Evenly Apply Gorilla Glue Onto the Dry Surface. Carefully apply onto the dry surface. Do not over apply. We recommend wearing gloves or spreading the glue with a disposable brush. 3. Clamp the Two Surfaces Together Tightly. Make sure the clamping pressure is distributed evenly across the surface. Or, if you dont have a clamp, use heavy objects or Gorilla Tape to achieve the appropriate clamping pressure. Clamp objects for 12 hours. For best results, allow 24 hours to cure. 4. Clean up: If you need to remove any uncured squeeze out or wet glue, we recommend wiping with a dry cloth or using a standard paint thinner. Once the glue is dry, it is best removed mechanically: Try sanding, chiseling, scraping or picking. 5. Storage Tips: After each use, wipe the bottles lid and nozzle clean with a dry cloth. While still squeezing, tightly replace the cap and then store in a cool, dry place. You should expect a year shelf life.

KYDEX V sheet forms to deep draws with low forces when heated to the upper end of the forming temperature range.

    "description": "[\"Gorilla Tape has taken duct tape to a new level. This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, its the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla Tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates rough surfaces. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32F (0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape. Weve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture.

(Available in black or white) view larger Panasonic NN-H765 1.6-Cubic-Foot 1250-Watt Inverter Microwave Oven The Genius Countertop Microwave Oven', 'Available in black or white, this 1250-watt microwave oven by Panasonic makes a stylish and convenient addition to any contemporary kitchen. The 1.6-cubic-foot unit with its 15-inch turntable perfectly cooks and evenly heats anything from breakfast foods and after-school snacks to dinnertime meals and appetizers when entertaining. Ideal for busy professionals and on-the-go families, the microwave oven provides quick and easy meal preparation while nicely accommodating surrounding decor.', 'Many people just use their microwaves for making popcorn or warming up soup because most microwaves just have one temperature setting--high. Conventional microwave ovens might have a low-power setting, but this is achieved by \"pulsing\" the high-power setting on and off rather than by emitting a steady stream of low-powered energy.', \"Panasonic's trailblazing Inverter technology delivers true, variable microwave power, which means even temperatures and consistent textures throughout the food being cooked. The consistent delivery of microwave energy allows delicate foods to simmer without the edges and surfaces overcooking, so foods have the look and taste you expect--without the wait.\", \"The Inverter microwave oven perfects the art of cooking, taking microwave cooking to a whole new level. You'll experience delicious food that better retains its color, nutrients, and flavor and that's easier and faster to prepare. Oh, and you can still make great popcorn.\", \"Furthermore, the Inverter power unit is smaller and lighter than conventional microwave circuitry (aka the heavy, enclosed side of the microwave), which allows for more interior space to fit that favorite casserole dish, without increasing the oven's overall exterior dimensions. Weighing just 29-4/5 pounds, the oven's roomy interior measures 18-1/2 inches long by 16-7/16 inches wide by 10 inches high, while its compact exterior measures 19-7/16 inches long by 21-7/8 inches wide by 12 inches high.\", \"With the touch of Panasonic's Sensor Cooking button, the microwave takes the guesswork out of creating a great meal, by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking or defrosting time. The sensor measures the amount of steam produced during cooking, and signals the microprocessor to calculate the remaining cooking time at the appropriate power level automatically.\", 'Panasonic evolved the Turbo Defrost feature, which allows you to defrost foods even faster than previous Panasonic Auto Defrost. Panasonic Inverter Turbo Defrost technology is an advanced microwave sequencing system using the inverter continuous-power delivery method.', 'The one-touch button allows you to set or add cooking time in 1-minute increments up to 10 minutes.', 'The Menu Action Screen is like having a chef to assist you in the kitchen. It scrolls step-by-step cooking instructions across the display, in a choice of English, Spanish, or French.', 'A pulsing delivery of very low microwave power keeps food temperatures at a constant level--without overcooking. So, foods like stew, gravy, and desserts remain warm in the oven for up to 30 minutes after cooking.', 'Time-of-day clock and versatile timer provide exceptional convenience.', 'The function key simplifies the programming of 10 useful, non-cooking functions. Just press the function key and the menu-action screen will display easy-to-follow steps to complete the desired function.', \"For safety, the oven's child safety lock prevents electronic operation (door still opens).\", 'The oven also provides 10 power levels, five cooking stages, more/less control, a popcorn button, and delay start.', 'Click here to view the set-up guide.', \"Create all your favorite recipes, quickly and easily, with Panasonic's Inverter microwave oven.\", 'Panasonic Inverter microwave ovens have been named the microwave-cooking method of choice by the prestigious Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Panasonic and the CIA have teamed up to develop a series of healthy and delicious recipes created especially for the Panasonic Inverter microwave oven.', 'The Master Chefs Microwave Recipes Made Easy cookbook includes preparation tips and professional techniques that will have you cooking like a pro with your Panasonic microwave oven in no time.', 'Choose from a variety of mouthwatering recipes--from goat cheese and red onion quesadillas to corn chowder with chilies and Monterey Jack to Mediterranean vegetable frittatas.

The 1018 carbon steel grade has low carbon content for a balance of strength, machinability, formability, and weldability. This material can be heat treated for higher hardness. The rod has been cold finished, a process of removing the outer layer to achieve the specified dimensions.', 'Steel is an iron alloy with carbon and other elements that modify the steel to achieve specific properties. In general, steels with higher carbon content have greater strength, hardness, and wear resistance, while those with lower carbon content have more formability, weldability, and toughness. Carbon steels, which include most AISI-SAE grades in the 1000 range, are classified by their level of carbon content as low (below 0.3%), medium (0.3% to 0.6%) and high (0.6% and above). Alloy steels, which include AISI-SAE grades in the 1300 and 4000 ranges and above, incorporate elements such as chromium, molybdenum, and nickel to modify properties like machinability and corrosion resistance. Tool steels, which include most grades with a letter and number grade designation, have high carbide content for wear resistance, high hardness, and the ability to hold a cutting edge. Some tool steels are designed to resist deformation when used in elevated temperatures.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate a materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughnessdescribes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Formability indicates how easily the material can be permanently shaped. Machinability describes how easily it can be cut, shaped, finished, or otherwise machined, while weldability characterizes the ability to be welded.\"]",

Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell- White Gorilla Tape is the perfect duct tape for both indoor and outdoor use. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32F (0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape. Weve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture.

The durable, 100% waterproof formula holds up indoors and out and bonds virtually anything including subfloor, mirrors, trim, drywall, landscaping, bath surrounds, foam board, marble and more. Directions: All surfaces should be clean and free of dirt, grease and oil. Best if used above 40F. 1. Unscrew nozzle, cut tip of cartridge, replace nozzle and cut to desired bead size. Insert into cartridge gun. 2. Apply adhesive to one surface in a zig-zag pattern or inside perimeter of the object. Be careful of squeeze-out. When working on rough, uneven surfaces, use enough adhesive to fill gaps. 3. Within 10 minutes, press surfaces together and hold for 20-30 seconds. NOTE: Heavy items may require temporary support. Use in conjunction with mechanical fasteners when hanging large mirrors. 4. Allow 24 hours to cure. Note that cure times will increase with lower temperature, humidity and if bonding non-porous surfaces. Gorilla Construction Adhesive is best if stored in a cool, dry location, with the nozzle attached filled with adhesive. The best way to store Gorilla Construction Adhesive for reuse is to leave the nozzle filled with adhesive attached to the cartridge between uses. The adhesive left in the nozzle acts as a cap and seals the material in the cartridge. If the cartridge is reused within a few days, the nozzle can be removed and the plugged material can be poked out and then reused. If it has been more than a few days, the easiest way to reuse, is the cut the nozzle farther to eliminate the plugged material.

Even with modern water-treatment facilities, water can be a significant source of dangerous contaminants, spreading acute and chronic diseases. Continual exposure to certain man-made chemicals can be highly insidious, causing damage over months or years with often serious and sometimes deadly effects. Chlorine, used for disinfection in many commercial and residential facilities, can react with organic matter to form cancer-causing trihalomethanes. Even naturally occurring contaminants can show up in drinking water with deadly consequences. According the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, E. coli bacteria is responsible for an estimated 73,000 cases of infection and 61 deaths per year in the United States. Lead is toxic when ingested and causes a wide variety of systemic and developmental problems in adults and children yet this metal can leach from old pipes and fixtures, making its way into drinking water. Many homes and offices built before 1988 may have lead-containing pipes and fixtures still in use. In the US, about 1,000,000 children under the age of six have an amount of lead in their blood that exceeds the level of concern. Pesticides have been discovered in every large watershed in the US. The dangerous synthetic chemicals used in pesticides have also been detected in an alarmingly high percentage of groundwater wells in the US.', 'Watersafe Well Water Test Kit was specifically designed to help you test quickly and easily for the most common contaminants found in private well water, including: iron, copper, lead, bacteria, pesticides, nitrates, nitrites, chlorine, pH and hardness. If your home draws from private well water, regular testing (recommended yearly or more) is the only way to ensure the purity of your water and safeguard the health of your family. From the experts at Watersafe, comes an affordable, easy-to-use and accurate test to determine the safety of your well water! Our new product is an essential addition to every home drawing from private water wells, giving you lab-quality results right in your own home.

This valve has a lever handle for manual on/off control. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) seats reduce the risk of leakage. The valve is standard port for with a higher flow coefficient resulting in a larger pressure drop for a given flow as compared to a full port valve. This valve has female NPT threads for connecting to male threaded pipes, creating a tighter seal than straight threads. The maximum pressure rating is 400 pounds per square inch (gauge) (psig) for water, oil, and gas (WOG), and 125 psig for working steam pressure (WSP). Ball valves use a spherical disc to control the flow between pipes, tubes, or hoses. Flow is allowed when the hole that pierces the ball-shaped disc is in line with the inlet and outlet of the valve. Flow is blocked when the ball is horizontally swiveled 90 degrees, so that the hole of the ball is perpendicular to the opening of the valve. Ball valves can be referred to as full port or reduced port (also known as regular or standard port) depending on the inner diameter of the valve. A ball valve is full port if the hole of the ball is the same size as the inner diameter of the connecting pipeline (resulting in lower friction) and is reduced port (standard port) if the hole of the valve is one pipe size smaller than the pipe, resulting in less flow through the valve than through the shaft of the pipe. Ball valves may have a handle or lever that aligns with the ball's position (open or closed) for manual operation. They are primarily used in air, gas, liquid, and steam applications. Smith-Cooper manufactures a wide variety of pipe fittings and valves. The company is headquartered in Commerce, California, and meets relevant ANSI, ASTM, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9002 standards.\"]",

Surface Preparation: The bonding surface must be relatively clean and dry. Contaminated surfaces should be cleaned with a 50/50 Isopropyl Alcohol and water mixture. A clean lint-free cloth should be used. Application: Shake 3M primer 94 well before using. Apply a thin uniform coating to the bonding surface using the minimum amount that will fully coat the surface. Allow 3M primer 94 to dry thoroughly before applying tape. This is usually accomplished in 5 minutes at room temperature. Be sure the primed surface remains free from contaminants prior to applying the tape. Porous surfaces may require 2 applications of 3M primer 94 for uniform coverage and good adhesion. Allow first application of primer to dry before applying the second coat. 3M primer 94 may be applied with brush or swab. It can also be applied with a pressurized flow gun, knurled roller or other similar type of application equipment. Clean up: 3M primer 94 can be removed with isopropyl alcohol.

Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, its the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla Tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates rough surfaces. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32F (0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape. Weve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture.

    "description": "['The Puffer R Duster is the Professionals Choice when it comes to crack and crevice treatments of fine dust products into small areas. This product has a 6-inch extension to treat hard to reach places.To use the duster, fill the tan rubber container (bellows) half-way full with an insecticide dust product such as Drione Dust or Delta Dust. It is recommended to place a small rock in the duster to help break up the dust and prevent it from clumping. Compressing the bellows will cause dust to escape the metal tip of the duster. Using a duster allows you to inject dust more easily into cracks and crevices or inside wall voids where insects like to hide. We highly recommend purchasing a duster when applying any dust products. Note: This hand duster does not come with an insecticide dust. You will have to purchase the dust separately. How do I properly use the hand duster? Remove black rubber cap from top of duster. The duster should be filled only halfway - no more than two-thirds full. This allows for adequate air space to create the desired air/dust mixture prior to application. If there is too much dust in the duster, clumps of dust on treated surfaces may result, leading to over application of the product and messy spills. Between each squeeze, the duster should be shaken slightly to get dust floating inside the duster. When applying dust into cracks and crevices and on surfaces, gently squeeze the duster to ensure the application of very thin layers of dust. When dusting correctly, you should barely be able to see the dust emerging from the tip of the duster. Before relaxing your grip on the duster, pull it away from the surface or crack you are treating to prevent sucking up lint, moisture or debris. Small amounts of these items will eventually cause lumping and/or clogging of the duster. In the event that the nozzle becomes clogged, you may unscrew the rod from the rear of the nozzle and insert it into the nozzle to break up any clogs.']",

Just attach a cloth, set Braava down, press a button and off it goes, using advanced robotic technology to track where it's been and where it needs to go. It's whisper-quiet too, so you can go about your daily activities without disruption. The included Turbo Charge Cradle is a convenient, one-stop charging and storage space, charging Braava 380t in as fast as two hours. Braava uses either disposable cleaning cloths, including Swiffer brand, or reusable microfiber cloths to remove dirt, dust and hair from your floors so you don't have to. Braava has two cleaning modes to choose from depending on the job you need done. In sweep mode, Braava dry mops your floors moving in straight lines using dry cleaning cloths. In mop mode, Braava uses a special back-and-forth mopping action and damp cleaning cloths to lift surface dirt and grime off your floors. With the Pro-Clean System included in Braava 380t, a special Reservoir Cleaning Pad dispenses liquid throughout the cleaning cycle to keep the cloth damp. Cleaning cloths are easy to attach and remove with Braava's removable magnetic multi-purpose cleaning pad. The NorthStar Navigation System 2 works like an indoor GPS that helps Braava keep track of where it has been and where it needs to go. The NorthStar Navigation Cube projects a signal that Braava uses to determine its location. Additional NorthStar Navigation Cubes can be purchased for the Braava 380t to expand the robot's dry mopping capabilities for bigger homes. As Braava cleans, it builds a map of the area, mapping walls, obstacles and drop-offs as it encounters them.

Theyre great for stairs and other surfaces like curtains, upholstery, auto interiors, and more. What are the benefits to cleaning with the BISSELL Zing Bagged Canister Vacuum? BISSELL Zing bagged canister vacuum makes any cleaning task seem effortless. The lightweight design and carry handle provide portable convenience. The Multi-Surface Floor Nozzle allows for easy cleaning of carpet, rugs and bare floors. The telescoping wand allows you to comfortably maneuver around and under furniture and also clean hard to reach areas like drapes and ceilings. When you are finished, the cord will automatically rewind with the push of a button. What is the difference between an upright vacuum and a canister vacuum? Canister vacuums are low to the ground vacuums that have a long hose with a wand on the end. As you clean through the hose and wand, you pull the canister unit behind you. Upright vacuums stand tall and have a handle, which is used to push the vacuum. When cleaning carpets, the debris is removed through the foot or base of the unit. Most uprights also have a hose and on-board tools, which are typically used for hard to reach places and when cleaning furniture.At one time, canisters were thought to be easier to use for cleaning hard to reach places and for cleaning a larger variety of floors surfaces. However, the uprights of today have added cleaning features, such as bare floor height adjustments, brush roll on/off switches, and are easily maneuverable. In addition, the on board cleaning tools have made upright vacuums even more versatile.Although uprights are easier to use and more effective at cleaning larger areas in the home, they can still be a challenge when cleaning stairs. Which type of vacuum is better -- bagless or bagged? Neither type of vacuum is better than the other. A bagged vacuum will lose its cleaning effectiveness as the bag fills with debris. The bag must be changed when it is about 1/2 to 2/3 full for the best cleaning performance. The choice between a bagged and bagless vacuum really depends on your personal preference.

The tubing is welded and drawn over a mandrel for a smoother bore than non-drawn welded tubing and a more consistent wall thickness than seamless tubing. It is cold rolled for greater yield strength and hardness than hot rolled steel. This round tubing meets ASTM A513 specifications for quality assurance and is suitable for use in applications such as in automotive air conditioning lines.', 'Metal tubing, also called fractional tubing, is used to transfer liquids, air, or solids, and it is characterized by a round shape and a hollow center. Metal tubing is commonly made with various grades of austenitic stainless steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and titanium materials and their alloys. Construction types include seamless, welded, or welded and drawn. Seamless tubing has no seam or weld point, which enables it to better withstand high pressure and resist corrosion. Welded tubing, made by rolling and welding metal sheet stock, is weaker than and not as rounded as seamless tubing, but it has a more consistent wall thickness for tighter wall tolerances. Welded and drawn tubing, also known as \"drawn over mandrel\" (DOM), is typically welded tubing that is drawn through a die and over a mandrel to create a smooth inner diameter, which gives the tubing comparable corrosion resistance to seamless tubing while still offering welded tubing\\'s tighter wall tolerances. Compression, vacuum, sanitary, and flared fittings connect tubing or redirect flow in a fluid handling system.

The purity level meets Grade A standard for MIL Spec TT-I-735A and ASTM D770, ensuring that no contamination occurs from its use.As a cleaner, it is fully miscible in water and most organic fluids, making it good at dissolving dirt, light organic contaminants, and ionic flux residues. Since the 824 is highly anhydrous (without water) and hygroscopic (absorbs humidity), it readily scavenges water off surfaces, trapping the water in the IPA solution as an azeotropic mixture. This helps to dehumidify surfaces.As a solvent, it acts as a moderate evaporation, plastic safe diluent and is used to improve the properties of paint resins and other heterogeneous solid mixtures. Therefore, it serves as a useful carrier solvent to adjust the rheological properties and compatibilities of complex mixtures. Due to IPAs volatility, it resists entrapment in the coating. As it dries, it gives off a very light odor, which is not bothersome but serves as a cue to limit over-exposure due to poor ventilation.Applications & UsagesSince Isopropyl Alcohol is safe for most plastics, seals, ceramics, and printed circuit board components, it is used heavily in the electronics industry. It is great for cleaning screens, stencils, fiber optics, cables, keypads, printed circuit board components, or electrical contacts and connectors. It is also used to clean oxides and grime on audio or video tape heads. It effectively removes light greases, oils, and flux without adding additional residues to contacts, relays, and circuit boards connectors. It is quick drying relative to water.

This inline valve has 1/4\" male and female National Pipe Taper (NPT) threads for connecting a female threaded pipe and a male threaded pipe going in the same direction. This full port ball valve is pressure rated to 400 pounds per square inch (psi) at a maximum operating temperature of 400 degrees F, and is suitable for use in air, water, or inert gas applications.', 'Ball valves use a spherical disc to control the flow between pipes, tubes, or hoses. Flow is allowed when the hole that pierces the ball-shaped disc is in line with the inlet and outlet of the valve and is blocked when the ball is horizontally swiveled 90 degrees, so that the hole of the ball is perpendicular to the opening of the valve. Ball valves can be referred to as full port or reduced port (also known as regular or standard port) depending on the inner diameter or the valve. A ball valve is full port if the hole of the ball is the same size as the inner diameter of the connecting pipeline (resulting in lower friction) and termed reduced port if the hole of the valve is one pipe size smaller than the pipe, resulting in less flow through the valve than through the shaft of the pipe. Ball valves may have a handle or lever that aligns with the balls position (open or closed) for manual operation. They are primarily used in air, gas, liquid, and steam applications.', 'Kingston manufactures safety valves, check valves, and flow control valves for industrial applications.

This caliper is used for measuring inside dimensions (ID), outside dimensions (OD), depth, and step. This product has a 1 year warranty offered by Fowler High Precision. If you experience any problem contact Fowler directly for warranty claims.', 'Shockproof spring anti-backlash control with a heavy-duty spring offers increased accuracy over standard gear configurations. Backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth in the caliper controls that prevents the gear teeth from jamming. It is undesirable to have much backlash due to the lack of precision offered by the increased amount of play between gears. Certain gear designs can minimize or eliminate backlash; spring anti-backlash systems use a spring to add a compressive force, thereby minimizing backlash.', 'This caliper has a knurled lock screw to hold the sliding jaw in position and help ensure a consistent measurement. A covered rack prevents dirt and debris from clogging the gear, and helps prevent measurement errors. A thumb-operated fine adjustment roller allows for one-handed use.', 'The caliper measures 0.10\" per revolution of the dial. The dial has 0.001\" graduations, and the beam has engraved 0.1\" graduations. The hardened stainless steel components, including the beam, measuring surfaces, rack, gears, and depth rod, offer corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and long life. Self-contained movement eliminates gear misalignment, while the dual pinion drive mechanism reduces wear on the rack and pinion. An adjustable dial enables setting zero. The hardened stainless steel is polished to a satin chrome finish, to help prevent glare. This caliper comes with a fitted case.', 'Dial calipers are measuring instruments commonly used for inspection in manufacturing to provide the precise measurements of an object. A pair of jaws attached to a long beam with a marked scale is used to measure inside, outside, and step measurements in standard or metric units. An additional depth probe slides along the beam to take depth measurements. One jaw is fixed to the end of the scale, while the other jaw slides along it to take measurements. A circular dial indicator is fixed to the movable jaw on a toothed gear rack that transfers movement of the jaws to the dial needle. The base measurement is taken from the long beam, which provides the initial whole measurement in inches or centimeters, and added to the dial reading, which provides fractional measurements in inches or millimeters. A locking mechanism provides the ability to take differential measurements for determining the difference in measurements between two objects. Compared to digital calipers, dial calipers are more durable, but are more susceptible to shock damage and prone to getting dirt in the gears, which can cause accuracy problems. Vernier calipers are more durable than dial calipers because they do not have internal moving parts, but they can be more difficult to read. Dial calipers are commonly used in fields such as metalworking, mechanical engineering, machining, and carpentry.', 'Fowler, an American company, manufactures inspection and measurement instruments such as electronic indicators, calipers, bore gages, and digital scales.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption.', 'Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughnessdescribes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation.

DMSO by itself is actually odorless, what makes Dimethyl Sulfoxide smell and taste like onions or garlic is DMS (Dimethyl Sulfide). Industrial grades of DMSO will contain DMS and therefore give off an offensive odor. Pure Pharma Grade Dimethyl Sulfoxide is distilled and purified to remove DMS and any other contaminants leaving it odorless. Dimethyl Sulfoxide, once considered a medical curiosity and now used in many regulated drug delivery and healthcare applications. The Toxicological aspects of DMSO have been studied extensively over a long period of time and it has been concluded to be a very low toxicity hazard in humans and animals via oral and parenteral routes. One of the highest concerns surrounding DMSO is that it can take everything through the skin. While DMSO by itself can penetrate fairly easily through the skin and does enhance the adsorption rates of some chemical compounds, it does not have a universal ability to take just anything through the barrier properties of human skin. Despite the past history, Dimethyl Sulfoxide is proven to be a safe versatile material. It should also be understood that when water is present as a cosolvent in DMSO the penetration kinetics are much lower.']",

The electronic caliper measures inside, outside, depth, and step values for versatility and includes a protective case and SR44 silver oxide battery.', 'Digital calipers are measuring instruments commonly used for inspection in manufacturing to provide the precise measurements of an object. A pair of jaws attached to a long beam with a marked scale is used to take inside, outside, and step measurements. An additional depth probe slides along the beam to take depth measurements. One jaw is fixed to the end of the scale, while the other jaw slides along it with gearless precision to take measurements. The reading is electronically generated and displayed on a digital, high-resolution screen as a single value. Digital calipers can take differential measurements, which are used to determine the difference in measurements between two objects, by zeroing the display at any point along the scale. Some digital calipers can switch between standard and metric units, and some can output readings to a computer or printer for recording measurements. Compared to dial calipers, digital calipers provide measurements that are faster, easier, and more error-free, but they are more fragile mechanically and electronically, and do not resist coolant well. Vernier calipers are more durable than digital calipers because they do not have internal moving parts, but they can be more difficult to read.

UHMW (ultra high molecular weight) polyethylene is an impact-, chemical-, and moisture-resistant plastic that has excellent abrasion resistance and a low-friction surface. UHMW is more rigid than LDPE and HDPE, and has better abrasion resistance than PTFE.', 'Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughnessdescribes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a materials ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.\"]",

The O1 tool steel grade has better machinability than A2 tool steel. It must be hardened in oil, which can be done at relatively low temperatures for good dimensional stability. The rod has been ground to achieve the precise shape and size.', 'Steel is an iron alloy with carbon and other elements that modify the steel to achieve specific properties. In general, steels with higher carbon content have greater strength, hardness, and wear resistance, while those with lower carbon content have more formability, weldability, and toughness. Carbon steels, which include most AISI-SAE grades in the 1000 range, are classified by their level of carbon content as low (below 0.3%), medium (0.3% to 0.6%) and high (0.6% and above). Alloy steels, which include AISI-SAE grades in the 1300 and 4000 ranges and above, incorporate elements such as chromium, molybdenum, and nickel to modify properties like machinability and corrosion resistance. Tool steels, which include most grades with a letter and number grade designation, have high carbide content for wear resistance, high hardness, and the ability to hold a cutting edge. Some tool steels are designed to resist deformation when used in elevated temperatures.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate a materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughnessdescribes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation.

HDPE (high density polyethylene) is a rigid, tough plastic that offers good chemical resistance and low moisture absorption. HDPE is stronger and more rigid than LDPE.', 'Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughnessdescribes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation.

The Backer Rod becomes an integral part of the joint into which it is installed, and therefore is available in a range of diameters to accommodate joints from 3/16\" to 1-5/8\" (5 to 41 mm). It limits the depth of the sealant, thereby preventing excessive use of the sealant, which promotes proper joint design. Because the sealant will not bond to the \"skin\" of the rod, it can stretch and recover with joint movement, with minimal stress being put on the points of adhesion to the substrate..

The set includes a 6\"/150 mm double extra slim taper, 6\"/150 mm slim taper, 8\"/200 mm half-round, 8\"/200 mm flat, 10\"/250 mm half-round, 10\"/250 mm flat, 10\"/250 mm round, 10\"/250 mm mill, and 12\"/250 mm mill file. The files have single-cut faces for use with light pressure, except for the half-round and flat files which have double-cut faces. All files, except the taper files, have a bastard cut for heavy material removal when finish is not a concern. The files are made from high-carbon steel for high strength and durability. The ergonomically shaped handles are rubber coated for comfort, grip, and increased control. The handles also have a hanging hole for storage and organization. The set comes in a red roll-up pouch with each compartment labeled with the file length, shape, and coarseness.', \"Files are toothed tools that offer a controlled way to remove material from intricate shapes. The shape of the object being filed establishes which file shape and length should be used. For example, a round file is recommended when filing concave surfaces or enlarging holes. File length measures the cutting face and does not include the handle or tang. The cut and coarseness of the file determines how much material will be removed with each stroke. A single-cut file has parallel rows of teeth covering its face, removing small amounts of material with light pressure to create a fine finish. A double-cut file has similar teeth as a single-cut file but is overlaid with a second set of parallel teeth facing the opposite direction. This second set of teeth increases the amount of material removed with each pass, generates a rougher finish, and requires heavier pressure than a single-cut file. A rasp-cut file has individually formed teeth that are raised above the tool's surface for removing large amounts of material from wood, aluminum, lead, and other soft materials. A curved-cut file has teeth arranged in parallel semicircles across the face of the file and is most commonly used for auto body projects. Most files are classified as American pattern or Swiss pattern, and each has their own coarseness rating system. American pattern files are rated bastard (coarse) cut, second (semi-smooth) cut, and smooth cut. Swiss pattern files are recommended for precision applications and have a larger rating scale from coarse (00) to extra smooth (6).\", 'Nicholson brand is manufactured by Apex Tool Group, maker of hand and power tools.

    "description": "['Pneumatic Plus SAW Series Filter-Regulators, or \"Piggybacks\" combine the functions of both filter and regulator. Piggybacks are compact and most effective when space is constrained. FILTER: Filtering out of dirt and foreign particles, and the separation of moisture is automatic with air flow. There are no moving parts and no adjustments are necessary. Accumulated sludge and moisture should be drained off. Sediment should not be permitted to fill above the lower baffle. Wash filter element at intervals with methylene chloride or similar cleansing fluid to maintain filtering efficiency. To clean element, depressurize system, pull down the lock and twist off the metal guard and polycarbonate bowl and unscrew element from head. Dry filter element thoroughly before reassembling. Clean filter bowl(s) only with soapy water. Inspect O-ring, replacing if damaged or distorted. Reassemble with care to avoid stripping threads on bowl. After a metal bowl with sight is tightened, it may be rotated up to 180 (for proper viewing.) REGULATOR: Before supplying the air, turn the adjusting knob counter-clockwise until compression is released from the control spring. Turn on the air supply and adjust the knob to set the desired secondary pressure by turning the knob clockwise. Note: Adjustment knob must be pulled away from the body of the regulator to operate. After desired secondary pressure is set, pushing the knob back towards the body will lock the control knob. IMPORTANT: Use care to avoid screwing fittings too far into body of units as it may close internal ports. Normally finger tight plus one turn will seal. Bowl (Metal or Polycarbonate) and Drain (Auto or Manual) Options available.']",

    "description": "['', 'Did you know that the whole earth is like a giant magnet? Liquid metals found in the deep core of the earth create convection currents that create magnetic forces found all over the earth\u2019s surface. Here at Master Magnetics, we specialize specifically in magnets and the different ways that magnets can be used to improve different aspects of life. Master Magnetics was founded in 1976 and is currently located in Castle Rock, Colorado. We manufacture and distribute magnetic products for commercial, industrial, and consumer use. We also have two exclusive distribution facilities located in California and Florida and another regional production and distribution facility located in Ohio. Our local production and distribution facilities allow us to create and ship magnetic products in a short amount of time and for a low price. This magnetic sheet with adhesive is the perfect canvas for so many projects. It can be cut into smaller shapes or used as one big sheet. The bigger the magnet, the stronger it holds. The magnet sheet can endure in temperatures between zero and one hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit. The whole sheet is 12 inches wide, 24 inches long, and 1/32 of an inch thick. You can even cut the sheet with scissors or a craft knife. Because of the large and flexible design, this magnetic sheet is ideal for vehicle signs, photo displays, puzzles, bumper magnets, or other craft projects. It\u2019s also incredibly easy to apply. Allow the roll to reach room temperature before unrolling. Then, unroll the magnet and stick it on a flat, magnetic surface for a few hours to flatten it. Do not try to bend the magnet backwards to get rid of the curl because magnets are naturally brittle and can crack. Once it\u2019s flat, cut the magnet into the shape you want or peel the paper from the adhesive and apply your design and then cut. Remember that magnets will stay better on clean and smooth surfaces. If you can dream it, you can make it!']",

    "description": "[\"Sheet metal screws have a pointed end and widely spaced threads. They're self-starting in thin sheet metal, but in thicker materials a drilled hole is recommended. Stainless steels are used for their corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength, scaling resistance, and low-temperature toughness. These properties account for their extremely wide use in practically every industry. Austenitic Stainless Steels are alloys of iron and carbon that contain between 16% and 30% Chromium, a maximum of 0.15% carbon, along with Nickel (or Manganese), and other alloying elements. The chromium, which helps develop a passive surface oxide film, provides corrosion resistance in stainless steels. Austenitic Stainless Steels are designated by a 3 digit SAE Stainless Steel Grade beginning with the number 3 (e.g. 304, 316). Another common naming convention for Austenitic Stainless Steels are 18/8, 18/10, 18/0, etc. where the 18 refers to the % of Chromium and 8 to the % of Nickel contained in the material. Similar to a flat-head style, the oval head style has a slightly convex top surface; it is typically used for appearance. The Phillips drive style was originally designed so that the driver would slip out under extreme torque, preventing over-tightening and damage to the fastener or the material. \"]",

Welded tubing, made by rolling and welding metal sheet stock, is weaker than and not as rounded as seamless tubing, but it has a more consistent wall thickness for tighter wall tolerances. Welded and drawn tubing, also known as \"drawn over mandrel\" (DOM), is typically welded tubing that is drawn through a die and over a mandrel to create a smooth inner diameter, which gives the tubing comparable corrosion resistance to seamless tubing while still offering welded tubing\\'s tighter wall tolerances.

Clear polycarbonate is often used as a lightweight, impact-resistant alternative to glass.

The most notable characteristics of plastic are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Some grades also offer optical clarity, a low-friction or self-lubricating surface, or exceptional impact resistance. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation.

    "description": "['', 'The Starrett 1202F-6 dial caliper measures 0 to 6 inches with 0.01 and 1/64 accuracy. This handy measuring tool allows for reliable and accurate depth, inside, and outside readings with the sharp, black graduations on the no-glare, satin-finished bar, crisp lines on the dial face, and knife edge contacts on the jaws. The dials inner, decimal scale is white, while the outer, fractional scale is yellow.', 'One full revolution of the dial is equivalent to 0.100. The knife-edge contacts can be used to scribe parallel lines on the workpiece. This caliper can be used with one hand through operating the fine adjustment roll with the thumb. The lock screw locks the dial bezel and holds the sliding jaw in position. The depth rod is integrated into the rack of the caliper, unlike many calipers which offer a detachable depth rod, or none at all. The hardened stainless steel components, including the bar, measuring surfaces, rack, gears, and depth rod, offer corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and long life. Positive double pinion anti-backlash control offers increased accuracy over standard gear configurations. Backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth in the caliper controls which prevents the gear teeth from jamming. It is undesirable to have much backlash due to the lack of precision offered by the increased amount of play between gears. Certain gear designs can minimize or eliminate backlash. Double pinion anti-backlash systems have two round gears (also called pinions) in contact with the rack gear that extends down the length of the caliper itself. The two pinions have a lower chance of disengaging with the rack gear than a single gear, thereby keeping the caliper more accurate than a single gear anti-backlash system. The rack teeth point down to keep foreign matter from clogging the gear operations. This prevents measurement errors where metal chips could interfere with proper caliper operation.', 'Calipers measure the distance between two opposing sides of an object. They make inside, outside, depth, or step measurements, according to their type. Calipers are commonly used in architecture, metalworking, mechanical engineering, machining, manufacturing, carpentry, and medicine. The simplest calipers have two legs to mark the two points and require a ruler to take the measurement. More complex calipers use two sets of jaws instead of legs and have up to two graduated scales. Vernier, dial, and digital calipers give direct and accurate readings and are functionally identical, having a calibrated scale with a fixed jaw, and another jaw with a movable pointer that slides along the scale. The vernier caliper has a scale sliding parallel to the main scale for an additional, fractional reading to improve measurement precision. The dial caliper has a circular dial with a pointer on a toothed gear rack replacing the second vernier scale. As with the vernier, this second measurement is added to the reading from the main scale to obtain the result. The dial caliper is used also for measuring size differential between two objects. The digital caliper takes the same sort of differential measurements as the dial caliper by zeroing the display at any point along the slide, with an LCD (replacing the dial) that displays a single, easily read value in both English and metric units. Some digital calipers can hold data readings between measurements and send them to data collection devices.', 'The L. S. Starrett Company was founded in 1880, originally manufacturing bench vises, squares, and other tools. They acquired other companies throughout the years, expanding their services into making precision measurement instruments and tools, such as calipers, micrometers, saw blades, and gauges. Starrett is headquartered in Athol, Massachusetts and has manufacturing facilities in Brazil, the United Kingdom, China, and other locations.', 'Starrett No 1202 Dial Calipers are based on the caliper that has been the first choice of professionals for decades. With the ability to provide quick, accurate measurement of O.D., I.D. and depth, the dial caliper is the most versatile precision hand tool on the market. Unlike vernier slide calipers, their inside measurement jaws can pass by each other, allowing internal measurements as small as .050-Inch']",

Copper, a term that applies to alloys containing at least 99.3% copper, offers very high thermal and electrical conductivity and provides corrosion resistance, formability, and machinability. Brass is an alloy of copper and varying levels of zinc, sometimes with additional elements. It provides greater strength and better machinability than copper or bronze. Bronze is commonly an alloy of copper and tin, but sometimes it is copper alloyed with other elements such as aluminum, phosphorus, manganese, or silicon. Tin gives bronze more corrosion resistance than brass and greater strength than copper. Copper and its alloys have temper designations, meaning the material has undergone a process to achieve certain properties of strength and hardness.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the material's overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium.

The dimensions of this bearing make it suitable for use in skateboards, inline skates, and scooters, among others. These bearings come in a pack of 10.', 'Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan.

    "description": "['', 'The Brown & Sharpe Dial-Cal dial caliper has a 1.25\" diameter rotating dial with a lock, is made of stainless steel, and measures in inches. The covered rack helps prevent measurement error by protecting the gear from foreign matter. Linear accuracy meets Deutsches Institut fr Normung (DIN) 862 standards. These calipers are for use in measuring inside dimensions (ID), outside dimensions (OD), depth and step.', 'The caliper measures 0.100\" per revolution of the dial. The lock screw locks the dial and holds the sliding jaw in position. Adjustable zero set allows the user to set zero at a convenient distance. The depth rod is integrated into the rack of the caliper, unlike many calipers that offer a detachable depth rod, or none at all. The hardened stainless steel components, including the bar, measuring surfaces, rack, gears, and depth rod, offer corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and long life. Spring anti-backlash control offers increased accuracy over standard gear configurations. Backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth in the caliper controls, which prevents the gear teeth from jamming. It is undesirable to have much backlash due to the lack of precision offered by the increased amount of play between gears. Certain gear designs can minimize or eliminate backlash; spring anti-backlash systems use a spring to add a compressive force, thereby minimizing backlash.', 'Calipers measure the distance between two opposing sides of an object. They make inside, outside, depth, or step measurements, according to their type. Calipers are commonly used in architecture, metalworking, mechanical engineering, and machining. The simplest calipers have two legs to mark the two points and require a ruler to take the measurement. More complex calipers use two sets of jaws instead of legs and have up to two graduated scales. Vernier, dial, and digital calipers give direct and accurate readings and are functionally identical, having a calibrated scale with a fixed jaw, and another jaw with a movable pointer that slides along the scale. The vernier caliper has a scale sliding parallel to the main scale for an additional, fractional reading to improve measurement precision. The dial caliper has a circular dial with a pointer on a toothed gear rack replacing the second vernier scale. As with the vernier, this second measurement is added to the reading from the main scale to obtain the result. The digital caliper takes a differential by zeroing the display at any point along the slide, with an LCD that displays a single value in English and/or metric units.', 'Brown & Sharpe manufactures precision measuring equipment and metrology hand tools. The company, founded in 1833, played a key role in setting industrial standards in the United States.

In general, steels with higher carbon content have greater strength, hardness, and wear resistance, while those with lower carbon content have more formability, weldability, and toughness. Carbon steels, which include most AISI-SAE grades in the 1000 range, are classified by their level of carbon content as low (below 0.3%), medium (0.3% to 0.6%) and high (0.6% and above). Alloy steels, which include AISI-SAE grades in the 1300 and 4000 ranges and above, incorporate elements such as chromium, molybdenum, and nickel to modify properties like machinability and corrosion resistance. Tool steels, which include most grades with a letter and number grade designation, have high carbide content for wear resistance, high hardness, and the ability to hold a cutting edge. Some tool steels are designed to resist deformation when used in elevated temperatures.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate a materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Formability indicates how easily the material can be permanently shaped.

They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others.', 'Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems.

This is an impulse sealer, meaning that it forms a seal when an electric current is passed through a thin wire or strip of metal (covered by a PTFE tape) to generate heat. This means there is no \"heat up\" time required. This sealer does not have a power switch, just plug it in, turn dial to desired heat setting, place the bag on top of the sealer, and then press the top handle down. (You will need to experiment with a test bag to find the optimum seal). You can adjust the time of the seal from the front knob, and when you press the top bar to seal, the red light will come on, and you will hear a click (this means the heating element is engaged). , And as soon as the seal is done, the red light will go off. . Please keep the handle pressed down for a few seconds to get optimal results. Lift handle, and inspect seal. You should not be able to pull the bag apart, and the seal should be uniform, running from end to end. Inspect the heat sealer for any build-up or burned plastic, wipe with dry cloth, keep the device clean. Great for home business, pharmacies, food products, coffee bags, CD\\'s, party favors.

WELD-ON 3 is a water-thin, non-flammable cement formulated to quickly develop high strength, clear bonds to many thermoplastic substrates, particularly acrylic. The bond is achieved by first softening the surfaces to be joined and then fusing them together with dissipation of the solvent. The initial bond forms within a few minutes and quickly increases in strength. Substantial strength will be obtained within only a few hours. Under certain conditions, especially with high humidity, a white mark on the plastic (commonly called blushing) may sometimes be encountered. Where a more blush resistant cement and longer open time is required, WELD-ON 4 is recommended. Weld-On 3 Acrylic Adhesive is a water thin, very fast set, solvent type adhesive for acrylics. It also bonds other plastics such as styrene, butyrate, and polycarbonates to themselves. Does not bond to cross-linked acrylics. SUBSTRATE RECOMMENDATIONS : WELD-ON 3 is formulated for cementing acrylic (poly-methyl methacrylate) plastic to itself. It will also form strong bonds with other thermoplastics such as polystyrene, CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) and polycarbonate to themselves. It is not recommended for cross-linked acrylic. SUGGESTED BONDING APPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: WELD-ON 3 is used extensively in sign fabrication. Strong butt joints are made with fat sheets by using the soak method for such applications as cementing letters to acrylic panels. Butyrate trim-capping of acrylics is another highly recommended use for WELD-ON 3 . It is also widely used in the POP industry (e.g. display), and in the fabrication and bonding of plastic containers, housewares, bottles and many other applications using the capillary method.

Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities.

The valve inlet has 1/4\" NPT male extended threads with a sealing washer and jam nut for mounting through a tank wall, and the valve outlet is free flowing. The valve inlet includes a compression fitting for use with 1/4\" tubing. The valve is made of National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) approved PVC (polyvinyl chloride), its replaceable seals are made of TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) for durability and chemical resistance, and its hardware is made of 18-8 stainless steel for corrosion resistance. The valve has a 1.5\" in diameter and 4\" long polyethylene float attached to the adjustable shutoff lever arm. This float valve is suitable for use in a variety of applications, such as fountains and livestock water tanks.', 'Float valves use a rod and float ball attached to a valve shutoff lever to control flow in or out of a tank. The float ball rises or falls with the level of liquid in the tank, changing the angle of the valve shutoff lever. When the angle of the valve lever changes sufficiently, the valve opens or closes. Float valves are rated according to the volume of liquid that can flow through them at a particular pressure to ensure the tank can be refilled as quickly as it is emptied. The material that a float valve is constructed from must be suitable for the liquid in which it operates, which may be corrosive or at an extreme temperature. Float valves are used to automatically regulate the level of liquid within tanks in a variety of applications, such as fountains, livestock water tanks, cooling towers, and chemical manufacturing plants.', 'Kerick Valve manufactures fluid level control valves for industrial applications.

Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying viewing abilities. A trinocular eyepiece is used to output digital images or video to an internal or external device such as a camera or monitor. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also use LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.', 'United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope.

    "description": "[\"You no longer have to accept the lower energy efficiency associated with envelope belts on fractional horsepower lightduty drives. Advanced V-belt technology has resulted in the development of a cut-edge, molded cog construction which exceeds conventional envelope belts in every performance category except oil resistance. This has been confirmed in extensive testing which proves that Continental ContiTech FHP V-belts run smoother and quieter, last longer, and substantially improve energy efficiency compared to noncogged belts. The cogged design of Continental ContiTech FHP V-belts (standard on 4L and 5L sizes) provides a greater surface area for heat dissipation and allows increased air flow around the belt during operation. These factors help to reduce internal belt temperatures and greatly improve belt life. The cogged design also improves flexibility, an especially important consideration where minimum or substandard sheave diameters are involved. Low cross section vibration in rubber-edged, cogged belts reduces noise generation. This allows you to take advantage of the longer life and high efficiency of FHP V-belts in noise-sensitive equipment. But even in typical factory settings, Continental ContiTech FHP V-belts contribute to a quieter operating environment. The historic inefficiency of FHP drives can be traced directly to the inability of a relatively large envelope belt to transmit a low-power force efficiently. Transmission loss is especially significant in factories using large numbers of drives and where small diameter sheaves are involved. The aggregate loss can be significant enough to have an adverse effect on equipment performance. Continental ContiTech FHP V-belts efficiency begins at 93% when used with smaller sheaves and increases dramatically as the sheave diameter increases. Since more of the rated power of the drive is delivered, actual performance nearly matches design performance. In addition, the efficiency of Continental ContiTech FHP V-belts offers you the opportunity to achieve full operating power requirements with a lower horsepower drive, reduced energy requirements, or both. These considerations can provide highly desirable economic advantages whether you're a drive manufacturer or a drive user.\"]",

    "description": "['INSTA-SET is a catalyst which acts as an accelerator that allows CAs to quickly cure in thick layers by enhancing the alkaline conditions during polymerization. INSTA-SET in a spray bottle is normally used to cure the CA that flows from joints when parts are pressed together. Applying an additional bead of thick CA along a seam and then curing it with INSTA-SET significantly enhances a joints strength. For difficult to bond materials, INSTA-SET can be applied to one surface and CA to the opposite surface. When brought together, they will bond instantly. INSTA-SET is formulated with a strawberry scent and activates CA in 6 to 8 seconds without any degrading of the CAs strength, which can occur with many other accelerators. It is compatible with all surfaces, even clear plastic and white foam. Directions in 5 different languages.']",

In order to purchase the right variable transformer, it is critical that you know the amp usage by your electronic device. It is always best to be conservative otherwise you risk destroying the variable transformer and it can be very dangerous. Most devices have a surge amperage (when first turned on) that is much higher than the device's operating amp rating. For example, if your device requires 3 amp, buy the variable transformer with up to 5 amp to account for the surge amperage. A rating of 300VA means that at 100volt, the unit can sustain at maximum 3amp. If at 120 volt the unit can sustain at 2.5amp. Note - Indoor use only.

Take one strip from the case and dip it into the solution you would like to measure. The colors of your strip will change instantly. Please note that not all two/four pieces of pH paper on your strip will change color - each piece has its own pH range and will change color accordingly. If testing saliva, do not put the strip into your mouth! 2. Quickly match these colors against the color chart on the front and back of your case to obtain the pH. Do not wait or let the strip dry! 3. The number above the matching colors on the chart is your pH. Any solutions with a pH beyond the pH range of your product will render inaccurate results.

A combination of characteristics including material, finish, construction, diameter, length, and breaking strength combines to give each rope its performance ability. Wire rope materials are selected for properties such as strength, elasticity, conductivity, and chemical- and weather-resistance. For strength purposes, most wire rope is made of bright (uncoated or bare) wire. However, it is also produced in a variety of finishes, such as polypropylene (PE), vinyl (PVC), or nylon. These coatings can increase overall durability and strength, and allow for specific use. The breaking strength for wire rope is the strength at which new wire rope will fail under a stationary load.

UHMW is more rigid than LDPE and HDPE, and has better abrasion resistance than PTFE.', 'Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughnessdescribes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation.

Welded tubing, made by rolling and welding metal sheet stock, is weaker than and not as rounded as seamless tubing, but it has a more consistent wall thickness for tighter wall tolerances. Welded and drawn tubing, also known as \"drawn over mandrel\" (DOM), is typically welded tubing that is drawn through a die and over a mandrel to create a smooth inner diameter, which gives the tubing comparable corrosion resistance to seamless tubing while still offering welded tubing\\'s tighter wall tolerances.

The filaments are universally designed and compatible with 3D Printers using 1.75mm diameter filament, with a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.05mm. Frequently Asked Questions 1) Filament not extruding properly? A: Check the type of filament you\\'re working with and set the proper extruder temperature based on the filament type and heated build platform if applicable; trial and error. Rule of thumb is to set the extruder temperature to the highest temperature for the specific filament, then decrease the temperature by 5C until properly extruded. Please note this will vary with each 3D printer. 2) How do I store my filament? A: Most filaments tend to absorb moisture from the air; because of this your filament can become brittle and slowly degrade the quality. It\\'s recommended to keep unused filament and store it in a storage container or zip lock bag with a desiccant. 3) Won\\'t the print stick to the build platform? A: First, review FAQ #1. Second, for PLA it\\'s recommended to use blue painters tape and ABS it\\'s recommended to use kapton tape. If printing with ABS and the print will still not stick to the build platform you can use \"*ABS Sludge\" a little goes a long way. You can use this on the build platform on top of kapton tape. *When creating the ABS sludge (mixture of acetone and ABS scraps), create the mixture in well ventilated area preferably outside. Using this sludge will make the print stick to the build platform really well and may be difficult to remove the print, use at your own discretion and a plastic scraper will come in handy.']",

The 464 brass alloy, also known as naval brass, has high corrosion resistance, especially to salt water, and provides good strength due to its high zinc content. The material has an H02 temper, meaning it has been cold worked to a 1/2 hard temper.', 'Copper, brass, and bronze are known as red metals because they contain copper, which has a reddish color. Copper, a term that applies to alloys containing at least 99.3% copper, offers very high thermal and electrical conductivity and provides corrosion resistance, formability, and machinability. Brass is an alloy of copper and varying levels of zinc, sometimes with additional elements. It provides greater strength and better machinability than copper or bronze. Bronze is commonly an alloy of copper and tin, but sometimes it is copper alloyed with other elements such as aluminum, phosphorus, manganese, or silicon. Tin gives bronze more corrosion resistance than brass and greater strength than copper. Copper and its alloys have temper designations, meaning the material has undergone a process to achieve certain properties of strength and hardness.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate the material's overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Formability indicates how easily the material can be permanently shaped. Machinability describes how easily it can be cut, shaped, finished, or otherwise machined, while weldability characterizes the ability to be welded.\"]",

These Pocket Hole Screws, with their Maxi-Loc/Square Drive/Washer Heads, ensures that the screw will seat in the bottom of the pocket hole every time.Sold in packs of 50, 100, 250, 500 or new 1,000 packs.Washer head seats screw, preventing a crushed pocket & run through.For hardwoods, choose the fine thread.For softwoods and particleboard, the coarse thread gives you the driving and holding you need, with a self-tapping wood auger tip.The square drive washer head properly seats the screw in the bottom of the pocket hole, preventing the head from crushing the pocket in softer woods and particle board. The auger points provide for easy installation and minimal splitting. The zinc finish reduces friction for easy installation and protects from rust. You just need a standard pocket hole step drill for both #7 and #8 screws.Optional Bin Boxes are available with your order.\", 'This 2-inch coarse-thread #2 square-drive washer head screw works well in softer material. The washer head of this screw is our most popular head style, as the wide bearing surface of the head will not overdrive in the bottom of the pocket. This is especially important in softer materials such as plywoods and composites. The screw also features a type-17 auger tip that self-taps its own hole, eliminating the need to pre-drill in even the hardest materials. Kreg screws also have larger-diameter steel shanks than many other screws on the market today making for an impressively strong screw that is almost impossible to break. Our screws have a bronze colored finish and a dry-lubricant coating that eases driving torque and provides greater rust resistance. For maximum rust resistance, look to our Sun-Seal coated weather resistant screws.']",

The filaments are universally designed and compatible with 3D Printers using 1.75mm diameter filament, with a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.03mm. PLA, or Polylactic Acid, is a commonly used thermoplastic material that does not require the use of a heated print bed. Blending a mixture of plant-based materials and polymers creates HATHCHBOX 3D Printer's PLA. Because of the lower melting temperatures and lack of warping, PLA filaments retain their color vibrancy and are a common choice for displays or small household prints.

    "description": "['MG Chemicals Wood Filament is made with a blend of polylactic acid (PLA) and wood particles. This material can be sanded and painted and has a sweet odor of wood. It has the ease of use similar to PLA and is great for artists and hobbyists who are looking to experiment with different printing materials. It is pretty much a drop in replacement for regular PLA and is quickly becoming a favourite to print with. Printing temperature ranges from 185 - 230 C (365- 446 F). Slowing down the print speed to 50%-60% will improve the smoothness of your print. Varying temperatures will affect the color of the final product. No heated bed is required. It is highly recommended this product be used with 0.5 mm nozzles or larger to avoid clogging. However, nozzles as small as 0.35 mm are being used with great success, sometimes using higher heat to avoid clogging. TIP: Try to avoid letting the filament sit in the hot end for any length of time while it is hot, as this tends to cause clogging. Wood fibers collect at the tip when left sitting in the hot end. Once it is printing keep it going. If you have to stop to do adjustments etc.. either pull the filament out of the hot end or let it cool down till you are ready to start printing again. These extra few steps will save you a world of time.']",

Its digital readout LCD shows inch or metric units for versatility, and either absolute or incremental measurement readings are user-selectable. The electronic caliper measures inside, outside, depth and step values for versatility and includes a protective case and CR2032 lithium battery. This product has 1 year arranty offered by Fowler High Precision. If you experience any problem contact Fowler directly for warranty claims. Digital or electronic calipers are measuring instruments commonly used for inspection in manufacturing to provide the precise measurements of an object. A pair of jaw attached to a long beam with a marked scale is used to take inside, outside and step measurements. An additional depth probe slides along the beam to take depth measurements. One jaw is fixed t the end of the scale, while the other jaw slides along it with gearless precision to take measurements. The reading is electronically generated and displayed on a digital, high-resolution screen as a single value. Digital calipers can take differential measurements, which are used to determine the difference in measurements between two objects, by zeroing the display at any point along the scale. Some digital calipers can switch between standard and metric units, and some can output readings to a computer or printer for reading measurements. Compared to dial calipers, digital calipers provide measurements that are faster, easier and more error-free, but they are more fragile mechanically and electronically, and do not resist coolant well. Vernier calipers are more durable then digital calipers because they do not have internal moving parts, but they can be more difficult to read.

    "description": "['Maxi-Cure extra thick CA is the best CA for most plastics, including GEs Lexan MAXI-CURE is the best choice for plastic model assembly. When used with INSTA-SET, it works better than any putty for modifying or filling voids. It can be carved with a knife or razor blade and sanded and feathered to form a finish indistinguishable from plastic. MAXI-CURE bonds fiberglass, hardwood, metal and rubber better than any other hobby adhesive. For gluing to the inside, cloth textured surface of fiberglass, scrape the area to be bonded with a razor blade or coarse sandpaper before using MAXI-CURE or any other adhesive. It also is best for bonding the tires for R/C cars. INSTA-SET is a catalyst which acts as an accelerator that allows CAs to quickly cure in thick layers by enhancing the alkaline conditions during polymerization. INSTA-SET in a spray bottle is normally used to cure the CA that flows from joints when parts are pressed together. Applying an additional bead of thick CA along a seam and then curing it with INSTA-SET significantly enhances a joints strength. For difficult to bond materials, INSTA-SET can be applied to one surface and CA to the opposite surface. When brought together, they will bond instantly. INSTA-SET is formulated with a strawberry scent and activates CA in 6 to 8 seconds without any degrading of the CAs strength, which can occur with many other accelerators. Maxi-Cure is very popular in the archery industry for fletching, which is the bonding of feathers and vanes to the ends of the aluminum and carbon fiber arrow shafts.Directions in 5 different languages.']",

    "description": "['Get outstanding 3D printing results when you use 1.75mm ABS 3D Printer Filament from Monoprice! ABS is one of the most commonly used filament types in 3D printing. It has a high tensile strength and good overall toughness. It has a low density and is softer than PLA, which means lower weight and lower cost when printing large models. Hardness is such that no white dot appears when bending. This 1 kg spool features a thickness of 1.75mm 0.10mm, with a roundness variation of only 0.05mm. It has a nominal processing temperature of 230C (446F). Thickness and roundness factors are laser measured at the factory to ensure accuracy over the entire length of the filament. The negatives of using ABS is that it can give off a white smoke with a concentrated odor. It is best to ensure that the printing room is well ventilated when using ABS. Additionally, it has a high moisture absorption rate. Depending on the overall humidity level of the printing environment, an opened spool can absorb enough moisture after a couple of days that high temperature printing could cause bubbles or pocks in the extrusion. It is therefore recommended to not open a spool until you are ready to print and to store any unused portion with with silca gel and/or an active dehumidifier to reduce the amount of moisture it can absorb.']",

This safety valve is American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) safety rated and displays the UV mark for pressure vessel safety valves. It also displays the NB mark for certification in accordance with NB-501, National Board Certification of Pressure Relief Devices. This safety valve has a 116 cubic feet per minute (CFM) flow rate and is suitable for low capacity pressure relief applications such as in home construction air compressors.', 'Relief valves remove excess pressure or vacuum from a system. The valve openings allow fluids or gases to escape to decrease pressure, and then close once the valve reaches the reseating pressure limit. They also relieve excess vacuum by opening to release a gas into the system and then closing after it reaches its low-pressure limit. Some relief valves have an adjustment mechanism to set the pressure where the valve opens, making it suitable for various applications. Relief valves are rated according to the volume of liquid or gas that can flow through them and the material that the valve is constructed from must be suitable for the fluid or gas, which may be corrosive or at an extreme temperature, in which it operates. Relief valves are used in a variety of applications, such as air compressors, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing, and power generation.', 'Control Devices manufactures valves and other flow control devices.

It has a stainless steel beam and slide for corrosion resistance and to help extend caliper life, thumb roller for fine adjustments, 1.6 inches (40-mm) jaws, and includes a depth rod to allow for depth measurement in addition to the standard inner diameter (ID) and outer diameter (OD) measurements that most slide calipers can perform. The LCD display is easier to read than a vernier caliper.', 'The caliper can be used with one hand by operating the fine adjustment roll with the thumb. The single battery is accessible, on the front of the plastic casing next to the LCD. To zero the caliper at any position, use the zero button. Linear accuracy meets the international Deutsches Institut fur Normung 862: Vernier Calipers Requirements and Testing (DIN 862) standards. Approximate jaw depth for the outside measuring jaws is 1.6 (40 mm). This caliper comes in a fitted plastic case with inspection certificate to help ensure conformity to technical specifications.', 'Calipers measure the distance between two opposing sides of an object. They make inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), depth, or step measurements, according to their type. Calipers are commonly used in architecture, metalworking, mechanical engineering, machining, manufacturing, carpentry, and medicine. The simplest calipers have two legs to mark the two points and require a ruler to take the measurement. More complex calipers use two sets of jaws instead of legs and have up to two graduated scales. Vernier, dial, and digital calipers give direct and accurate readings and are functionally identical, having a calibrated scale with a fixed jaw, and another jaw with a movable pointer that slides along the scale. The vernier caliper has a scale sliding parallel to the main scale for an additional, fractional reading to improve measurement precision. The dial caliper has a circular dial with a pointer on a toothed gear rack replacing the second vernier scale. As with the vernier, this second measurement is added to the reading from the main scale to obtain the result. The dial caliper is used also for measuring size differential between two objects. The digital caliper takes the same sort of differential measurements as the dial caliper by zeroing the display at any point along the slide, with an LCD (replacing the dial) that displays a single, easily read value in both English and metric units. Some digital calipers can hold data readings between measurements and send them to data collection devices.', 'Standard Gage manufactures precision measuring equipment and metrology hand tools, and is a product line by Hexagon Metrology.

    "description": "['The Flex-Hone tool was originally created by Brush Research Manufacturing to deglaze cylinder walls in automotive applications. Brush Research embraced the benefits of a plateau finish and pioneered the concept of plateau honing culminating in the introduction of the Flex-Hone tool in 1972. The Flex-Hone has gained many nicknames over the years and including ball hone, ball style hone, flexihone, dingleberry hone, bead brush, glaze breaker and glaze buster. Flexible honing with the Flex-Hone tool produces an oil holding cross hatch pattern and a true plateau finish free of cut, torn and folded metal. Any type or size of cylinder can benefit from the Flex-Hone. These abrasive bead style brushes are produced in standard diameters from 4mm to 36 inches. Nine abrasive types are offered including silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, boron carbide and diamond allowing the tool to be tailored to finish any base material. A choice of 11 different grit selections are available for precise control of finish parameters. The elimination of peaks results in rapid ring seating, better oil control, reduced seepage in hydraulic and pneumatic applications and provides better seal performance and longer seal life. Successful applications include firearm chambers, shotgun barrels, musical instruments, combustion chambers, air compressors, pumps, valve bodies, valve guides, brake cylinders, wheel cylinders and the list goes on and on. Flex-Hone tools are also very effective for deburring cross drilled holes, port radiusing and edge blending. Because of its unique construction, the Flex-Hone is self-centering, self-aligning, and self-compensating for wear so it does not require an elaborate set-up or special training. Deburring can be effectively automated and combined in the machining process to allow a complete cylinder finish in one operation or it can be employed as a secondary operation with equal results.']",

    "description": "['', \"Gizmo Dorks metal copper fill filament is a new filament that allows unique prints with a metallic look and finish. Metal copper filament is a unique blend made by combining real copper powder with PLA filament, and the filament prints very similar to normal PLA. The filament can be printed on either heated or non heated build plates. It's suggested to print on blue painters tape, and there is essentially no warping. If a heated build plate is used, then please set it to 60 C, and the print will have an increased adhesion to the platform. Metal copper fill can also be printed on regular glass, glass with glue stick, or kapton tape.\", 'Heat migration through the filament should be a very important consideration when using metal copper fill. Since the filament has real copper powder, heat will travel through the filament faster than normal. The copper filament will heat up in the hot end faster and cool down on the platform faster as well. Since it heats up faster, generally the hot end can be set to extrude at lower temperatures while allowing for faster print speeds. Normally, faster cooling when leaving the nozzle means means better performance on parts that overhang such as a chin or nose. Sometimes there are instances where heat migration through the filament is bad. For example, the heat might migrate up through the filament causing it to expand creating friction.', 'Metal copper filled prints can be post processed. Start with using coarse steel wool to polish the surface. Remember this is just a polish and there is not that much pressure needed. Follow it up by applying a thin coat of black spray paint and immediately wiping it off with a cloth. This will leave the places that are harder to reach with a slight black tint giving it a beautiful contrast. Lastly, a copper polish can also be used to give a brighter shine and give some patina.']",

Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan.

They generally feature a smooth, unthreaded shank below the head which ensures a tight attachment, and the threaded portion of the shank is tapered to increase the holding power. Threads specially designed for use in wood effectively resist pulling out. Brass is rust proof, corrosion resistant and polishes to a rich, golden color. Brass is easily soldered and brazed and accepts plating readily. The typical composition is 70% Copper and 30% Zinc. Strength increases with a higher percentage of Zinc.Round head fasteners have a dome-shaped head. An older style of head, it is typically used when replacing existing round-head fasteners where an exact match is desired. The Phillips drive style was originally designed so that the driver would slip out under extreme torque, preventing over-tightening and damage to the fastener or the material. ']",

Stainless steel 304 is a versatile material, commonly used in a wide variety of applications, and in saline atmospheres. Vinyl, also called Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), is corrosion-resistant, lightweight, and has high strength. It resists reactions with acids, gasolines, alcohol, and hydrocarbons. It is flexible, and is resistant to weather and ultra-violet (UV) rays. Vinyl coating is a hard, durable plastic that resists most chemicals, has excellent dimensional stability, and can be sterilized. It resists oil, has absorbs low levels of moisture, and is non-conductive. 7x7 strand core has seven strands of wire rope with seven wires in each strand, formed helically around a strand core. 7x7 strand core is stronger but less flexible than 6x19 and 6x36 class constructions.', 'Wire rope, also called wire cable, is an assembly of wire strands formed helically around a central core. It is used for pulling, lifting, rigging, hoisting, and motion-control applications most commonly found in the manufacturing, marine, oil, mining, fiber-optics, aircraft, automotive accessory, and construction industries. A combination of characteristics including material, finish, construction, diameter, length, and breaking strength combines to give each rope its performance ability. Wire rope materials are selected for properties such as strength, elasticity, conductivity, and chemical- and weather-resistance. For strength purposes, most wire rope is made of bright (uncoated or bare) wire. However, it is also produced in a variety of finishes, such as polypropylene (PE), vinyl (PVC), or nylon. These coatings can increase overall durability and strength, and allow for specific use. The breaking strength for wire rope is the strength at which new wire rope will fail under a stationary load. Breaking strength is not considered safe working load (SWL) limit.']",

The circular dial comes in 1.5\" (40 mm), 2\" (50 mm), 2.5\" (63 mm), and 4\" (100 mm) diameters. The dial has an aluminum black pointer. The lens for the 1.5\", 2\", and 2.5\"diameter dials is polycarbonate for high impact resistance. The lens for the 4\" diameter dial is glass for strength and clarity.

This pressure gauge is suitable for plumbing, heating, air conditioning, pneumatic, hydraulic, water tanks, and air compressors.', 'Pressure gauges are instruments used to measure the pressure of a gas or liquid inside a vessel and, often, to help ensure the optimal amount of pressure for a given application. Pressure gauges can range from everyday instruments, such as those used to measure the air pressure in a car or bicycle tire, to highly accurate gauges used in mechanical and industrial processing. Most often, pressure gauges measure pressure relative to another reference. For instance, gauge pressure measures pressure relative to ambient air. An example of a pressure gauge measuring relative to ambient air is a tire pressure gauge or a blood pressure gauge. Differential pressure is the difference in pressure between two points, such as when measuring liquid flow along various points in a pipeline. An absolute pressure gauge measures pressure relative to a perfect vacuum, such as an atmospheric or barometric pressure gauge. All types of pressure gauges include either a male or a female mount to connect to the vessel where pressure is being measured, and display results on a dial with varying increments of measure across a given range.', 'Winters Instruments manufactures pressure gauges, thermometers, diaphragm seals, pressure transmitters, and switches.

WELD-ON 4 is a water-thin, somewhat flammable cement formulated to quickly develop very clear and high strength bonds for many thermoplastic substrates. The bond is achieved by first softening the surfaces to be joined and then fusing them together with the dissipation of the solvent. The initial bond forms within a matter of minutes and is followed by a significant and continual increase in bond strength over the next several hours. WELD-ON 4 may be preferred by some plastic fabricators because it is less likely to leave white marks (commonly called blushing). For similar applications but faster setting cement, WELD-ON 3 is recommended. Weld-On 4 Acrylic Adhesive water thin, somewhat flammable, moderately fast-setting, blush-resistant solvent cement for bonding acrylic. It will also bond with other thermoplastics such as polystyrene, CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), and polycarbonate to themselves. Does not bond to cross-linked acrylics. SUBSTRATE RECOMMENDATIONS : WELD-ON 4 is formulated as a blush-resistant cement for bonding acrylic (poly-methyl methacrylate) to itself. It will also form strong bonds with other thermoplastics such as polystyrene, CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), and polycarbonate to themselves. It is not recommended for cross-linked acrylic. SUGGESTED BONDING APPLICATIONS: WELD-ON 4 is used extensively in sign fabrication for cementing acrylic letters to fat acrylic presentation panels and trim-capping of cut out acrylic letters. Strong butt joints are made with fat sheets by using the soak method. WELD-ON 4 is also widely used in many applications e.g. fabrication of display and presentation cases, medical equipment assembly, the bonding of plastic containers and pre-forms, and in the manufacture of numerous solvent welded structures and subassemblies using the capillary method.

    "description": "[\"The v6 HotEnd Full Kit from E3D has been redesigned for your convenience from the ground up! This new hot end contains the same signature high temperature performance for high-temp printing, as well as increased functionality for printing soft and flexible filaments. The v6 HotEnd allows you to print a wide variety of materials, from soft and flexible to sturdy and strong. This is possible due to the PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) liner tube through the hotend that you can extend into your extruder - this gives the ability to add the confinement and constraint needed to make excellent quality prints with flexible filaments. This technology opens new doors for your 3D printing aspirations. With High Temperature Performance, you can print with high-temp materials like Polycarbonate and Nylon - this also eliminates HotEnd meltdown failures that are common with PTFE designs. Even though the v6 has a PTFE liner inside the hotend the liner is never subjected to high temperatures so there is no risk of damaging the liner through overheating. Basically, this design is really in-tune with all the elements, so your prints will come out crisp and accurate. The v6 has cut back on a bunch of bulk. This clean-cut version's overall length is only 62mm, and there are significant reductions in the X/Y dimensions by using the new injection moulded fan duct. Are you eager to start printing right away? Good. So are we - and that's why here at MatterHackers we praise the v6 HotEnd. No adhesives, Kapton tape, or soldering is needed to get started. The new v6 simply locks into place with a little screw, high-temp glass sleeving is used to insulate the thermistor legs. This makes installing the hotend (as well as removing) a quick and smooth process compared to earlier methods involving various adhesives.The parts of the hotend just screw together, and the fan duct naturally clips in - this can be manipulated in different ways to suit your setup preference.\"]",

    "description": "['', 'The classic, original, the gold standard. PTFE was the \"miracle\" fluoropolymer invented in the 1940\\'s by DuPont - a product originally without a market and hard to process. Most other materials continue to use PTFE as a reference for chemical resistance.', 'The high viscosity in the gel state (it does not truly melt) of PTFE prevents it from being processed conventionally in extruders or injection molding. It is therefore dry molded or extruded in hydraulic extruders with (paste extrusion) or without (ram extrusion) lubricants. Paste extrusion of PTFE yields a flexible tubing. However, it occurs in a batch process and thus long continuous lengths are limited to the batch size, unlike the melt processable fluoropolymers - FEP, PFA and ETFE. The unique properties of PTFE cover an impressive range - high use temperature compared to other polymers, almost universal chemical resistance, excellent electrical properties at high voltage and high signal frequencies, non-stick characteristics, usefulness under extreme low temperatures (cryogenic conditions), UV resistance. However, mechanical strength and wear resistance are not criteria for which PTFE is recommended - which is one reason for the development of FEP, PFA and ETFE.', 'Manufactured by Fluorotherm in the USA, it is semi-transparent in color and FDA approved.']",

The valve can be adjusted to open between 0 and 100 psi using the micrometer-style nylon knob. This safety valve has an 6 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) flow rate and is suitable for low flow pressure relief applications such as in tankless air compressors.', 'Relief valves remove excess pressure or vacuum from a system. The valve openings allow fluids or gases to escape to decrease pressure, and then close once the valve reaches the reseating pressure limit. They also relieve excess vacuum by opening to release a gas into the system and then closing after it reaches its low-pressure limit. Some relief valves have an adjustment mechanism to set the pressure where the valve opens, making it suitable for various applications. Relief valves are rated according to the volume of liquid or gas that can flow through them and the material that the valve is constructed from must be suitable for the fluid or gas, which may be corrosive or at an extreme temperature, in which it operates. Relief valves are used in a variety of applications, such as air compressors, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing, and power generation.', 'Control Devices manufactures valves and other flow control devices.

The input impedance of an oscilloscope is typically 1 megohm at the connector. This impedance mismatch can cause a large numbers of anomalies and artifacts on the measured signal that wouldnt normally be there along with causing inaccurate amplitude measurements. Providing a 50 Ohm input impedance at a oscilloscope input allows measurements without disturbing the impedance matching of the circuit under test. For example, passive filters that are designed for 50 Ohm source and load impedance will display drastically different characteristics when terminated with anything other than 50 Ohms.']",

The frame is made from steel and aluminum for durability, and it has a black powder-coated finish to protect against wear. The printer head moves on the Y (backward and forward) and Z (up and down) axes, while the print bed moves on the x (left to right) axis. The steel and aluminum print bed is warp resistant and includes an auto-leveling probe that works with the user-chosen computer software to provide a level print surface. The hot end has a maximum resolution of 100 microns and includes a fan to help solidify the molten filament as it is extruded onto the print bed. The printer uses open source software and connects to the computer using the included mini-USB cable. Using an SD card (sold separately), the printer can be disconnected from the computer after initialization for untethered printing during long print jobs.', 'The guide rails have a 12-mm diameter for stability and have linear bearings for smooth vertical movement of the print head.

The print material is provided in filament or wire form and is fed through an extruder within the print head, similar to how ink is used in a standard printer. A printer with a single extruder can print using one filament at a time; a printer with dual extruders can print with two different materials or colors at the same time. The thickness of the printed layers can be customized for each print, but the thinnest layer that a printer can lay is called its maximum resolution. Choosing to print using very thin layers will create parts with more detail, but will typically take longer to print. To lay the material in the correct way, the print head and bed typically move in a combination of X-axis (left and right), Y-axis (forward and backward), and Z-axis (up and down) movement.', 'Printrbot manufactures desktop 3D printers and accessories.

The printer, which has all components required for assembly, has a steel and aluminum frame for durability and a black powder-coated finish to protect against wear. The printer head moves on the Y (backward and forward) and Z (up and down) axes, while the print bed moves on the x (left to right) axis. The steel and aluminum print bed is warp resistant and includes an auto-leveling probe that works with the user-chosen computer software to provide a level print surface. The hot end has a maximum resolution of 100 microns and includes a fan to help solidify the molten filament as it is extruded onto the print bed. The printer uses open source software and connects to the computer using the included mini-USB cable. Using an SD card (sold separately), the printer can be disconnected from the computer after initialization for untethered printing during long print jobs.', 'The guide rails have a 12-mm diameter for stability and have linear bearings for smooth vertical movement of the print head.

The print material is provided in filament or wire form and is fed through an extruder within the print head, similar to how ink is used in a standard printer. A printer with a single extruder can print using one filament at a time; a printer with dual extruders can print with two different materials or colors at the same time. The thickness of the printed layers can be customized for each print, but the thinnest layer that a printer can lay is called its maximum resolution. Choosing to print using very thin layers will create parts with more detail, but will typically take longer to print. To lay the material in the correct way, the print head and bed typically move in a combination of X-axis (left and right), Y-axis (forward and backward), and Z-axis (up and down) movement.', 'Printrbot manufactures desktop 3D printers and accessories.

    "description": "[\"This is Micro Swiss All Metal Hotend kit with redesigned cooling block for Wanhao i3 with the following improvements: Micro Swiss All Metal Hotend Kit Features: All metal hotend upgrade for MK10 style extruders. This upgrade includes a modified thermal barrier tube and modified nozzle with modified cooling block. Thermal barrier tube is made from 2 different materials. The lower thermal break is made from stainless steel, and the colder upper part is made from aluminum. Stainless steel was used for thermal break because it offers low thermal conductivity, and aluminum was used for the upper portion because it has a lot better thermal conductivity, to carry away any heat from the filament. All metal hotend will let you print at much higher temperature then possible with original PTFE lined one. Another benefit of an all metal hotend design is more consistent melt chamber control. During slow extrusion rate, in PTFE lined hotend, transition zone from solid to molten plastic tends to creep upward creating more stringy prints. With all metal design a transition zone is always constant, being located right at the heat break. With fast extrusion rate, PTFE tube doesn't have enough thermal conductivity to properly melt all the plastic coming out. On MK10 extruders that limitation happens around 60 mm/s, depending on nozzle size. All metal hotend solves this problem, plastic is surrounded by thermally conductive nozzle throughout its length.

It has a high glass transition temperature to reduce deformation, but it is also low enough to be safely attainable with standard 3D printers. ABS is a hard strong plastic with some flexibility when compared to PLA. It is also soluble in Acetone, and it can be easily sanded and machined.Compatible with RepRap, Makerbot, UP!, Lulzbot, Afinia, Solidoodle, MakerGear, Printrbot LC, and more!FAQ?Is the spindle hole large enough to fit my Makerbot printer?Yes! Our spindle holes are large enough to fit the Makerbot printers. You don't have to worry about fabricating a spindle extension any longer. *NOTE, these spools will not fit inside of the new Makerbot 5th generation printer drawers. You can still use these spools and feed the filament directly through the top of the printer.What other colors are available?ABS comes in a variety of different vibrant colors, 30 different options total.*New fluorescent colors are available. They glow under UV light, commonly known as black light.*New color changing filaments are available; the filaments will change colors at 31C (88F). The filament is one color below 31C, and when it is heated above 31C, the filament will change to another color.*New conductive ABS filament available.

The valve has a 1.5\" in diameter and 4\" long polyethylene float attached to the shutoff lever arm. This float valve is suitable for use in a variety of applications, such as fountains and livestock water tanks.', 'Float valves use a rod and float ball attached to a valve shutoff lever to control flow in or out of a tank. The float ball rises or falls with the level of liquid in the tank, changing the angle of the valve shutoff lever. When the angle of the valve lever changes sufficiently, the valve opens or closes. Float valves are rated according to the volume of liquid that can flow through them at a particular pressure to ensure the tank can be refilled as quickly as it is emptied. The material that a float valve is constructed from must be suitable for the liquid in which it operates, which may be corrosive or at an extreme temperature.

KYDEX V sheet forms to deep draws with low forces when heated to the upper end of the forming temperature range. Unlike many other thermoforming sheets, KYDEX V sheet has unusually high resistance to hot tearing. Forming Guidelines - Oven temperatures should be set differently than the settings used for ABS or FR-ABS. - Typical heater settings (percentage timers) are 30% - 50% top heaters and 50% - 70% bottom heaters. - The most frequent problem is trying to heat the sheet too quickly, particularly on the primary surface. - Cycle times will vary depending on the oven conditions and grade of KYDEX V sheet being formed. - When forming KYDEX V sheet, it is better to rely on the sheet appearance during heating than on fixed cycle times. - Forming temperatures - Guidelines: (Sheet should not exceed 204C (400F). 165 - 177C (330 - 350F) for < 1.50mm (0.060\"). 182 - 196C (360 - 385F) for 1.50mm to 3.20mm (0.060\" to 0.125\"). 196 - 204C (385 - 400F) for > 3.20mm (0.125\") - Ideally the core sheet temperature should be within 10F of the surface temperature. Sheet Appearance During Heating As KYDEX V sheet is heated, the inherent stresses in the sheet will relax. Stage I: The heating is marked by wide undulations and softening. Stage II: The material will start to form small ripples (known as oil canning). . Stage III: The material will start to smooth out and sag (KYDEX V sheet will generally sag less than other thermoplastics due to its high melt strength. . Stage IV: The ripples will have smoothed out indicating that most stresses have been removed. 10 to 30 seconds afterwards the sheet is ready to form.']",

The bearing has a dynamic (radial) load rating of 12.8 kN and a static (axial) load rating of 6.65 kN. This one-piece pillow block housing allows for a stationary outer ring and rotating inner ring. The bearing is secured to the shaft with set screws to prevent slippage and the housing requires two 3/8 bolts (sold separately). This mounted bearing is used in industrial manufacturing, food and beverage manufacturing, and in the textile industry.', 'Mounted bearings combine a bearing mounted inside a housing unit. The bearing housing replaces the need for a casting or weldment to position the bearing securely for reliable operation, and its design determines the type of insert bearing. Insert bearings use rolling elements (ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindled, or tapered) to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction, and to support radial and axial loads. Available in a variety of materials and mounting configurations, mounted bearings can be one- or two-piece, they can have an extended inner ring and locking device, and they can have seals and end caps that retain lubrication and protect the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris. Mounted bearings support shafts in a variety of mounting configurations (flange block, hanger, pillow block, and take-up block), and are used in a range of applications from light duty shaft guidance on conveyors to road building equipment and crushers.']",

The heater is built for use with 120 volts AC, drawing 1 amp thus producing 120 watts. It has a preset thermostat set for 90 F / 32 C ( 10 F / 5 C). The PBL20 band style cylinder heaters allow you to draw propane at increased rates in cold weather conditions versus an unheated cylinder. This innovative heat-spreading technology insulates, protects and maintains heat to help you keep your pressure up and reduce the frequency of cylinder refills.

Rest assured that these heaters are the real deal! They are more efficient and safer than other heating elements on the market and certified to ETL, UL, CSA & CE safety standards. Keep your drums, barrels, buckets, pails & gas cylinder propane tanks warm in bitter climates so that you don't lose any production time, saving you both time and money. On those occasions when you dont need all the extra strength and durability, however, theres no use paying for more than you need, right? Thats why we created our Lite line.

Then we ship it to Amazon warehouses where our inventories are kept small and replenished as often as weekly. This is important because natural rubber is a perishable product for which proper storage and age matter. Although our primary focus is spearfishing accessories, many of the products we sell have a myriad of other applications.

    "description": "[\"Taulman Bridge filament was created to accomplish the following: Lab certified measure of tensile strength. Better Adherence to the Printing platform. Lower Price Reduced water up-take from local humidity Non-destructive evaluation (Opacity) Reduced Shrinkage The great thing about Taulman Bridge filament is that it maintains the superb strength of Nylon while having less warping, better adhesion to the bed, and just being easier to print. This material is ideal for printing industrial and household goods such as gears, machine parts, or even 3D printer replacement parts. We recommend starting off with Bridge filament before moving on to other Nylons since it's easier for beginners to work with. Additionally, Bridge is significantly stronger and more durable than both PLA and ABS. Taulman has done a great job creating this material. If you have printed with Taulman 618 and 645 you will know that there are challenges to printing those Nylons (which can be overcome). This material has been extensively used to print prosthetic parts such as fingers and hands. You can print this material straight onto glass and use some PVA glue or Elmers glue to get it to stick properly to the bed. Bridge has much stronger adhesion to the bed and the edges of the filament don't curl upward as easily. When printing support materials you can easily remove the bridge support material (which is a major improvement from past Nylon variations). Basically you can print this material and easily break off the support and then you are good to go - no sanding or polishing is necessary. Even a Bridge part printed with very low infill will maintain strength and durability.\"]",

Limited Lifetime Warranty!', '', 'The PanaVise 209 vacuum base Pv Jr. is a portable work-holding tool attaches to smooth, flat, non-porous surfaces, and adjusts to a wide range of positions. The PanaVise 209 vacuum base PV Jr. is designed for light-duty uses such as field repairs, electronics, and hobbies. It has a rubber base and lever combination at its surface contact, and features tilt adjustment up to 210-degrees, along with 360-degree turns and rotations, fine and coarse clamping abilities, grooved jaws for easy holding power, and heat-tolerant jaws.', 'The PanaVise 209 vacuum base PV Jr. is a one-piece work-holding tool with specialized elements at its base and head. The rubber base is 3-3/8\" (86.4 mm) wide, with an integrated lever along its upper edge. A downward flip of the lever lifts the inner center of the base up when against a nonporous surface, creating a vacuum action powerful enough to secure the holding tool and the item secured within its jaws. The unit can be used on horizontal or vertical planes, and a dual adjustment mechanism on the vise head allows for both coarse and fine adjustments. The holding power of the jaws can be softened with an optional padded accessory for holding extremely delicate items (sold separately). The head element of the PanaVise 209 vacuum base PV Jr. has jaws composed of reinforced thermal composite plastic that are 2\" (50.8 mm) tall x 1\" (25.4 mm) wide, and open to 2-7/8\" (73 mm). The grooves along the jaws\\' inner edges are designed for dependable holding power of all kinds of items. Because vise applications such as circuit board wiring and jewelry making- involve soldering, the vise head assembly of the PanaVise 209 vacuum base PV Jr. is highly heat resistant, with continuous heat tolerance to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) and intermittent heat tolerance to 450 degrees F (204 degrees C).', 'The PanaVise 209 Vacuum Base PV Jr. utilizes PanaVise single-knob \"split-ball\" functionality at the point of contact between its base and vise head. Once an item is secured within the head, the split-ball system allows for maneuvering separate planes (tilt, turn and rotate). The complete range of mobility possible with the 209 Vacuum Base PV Jr.\\'s split-ball system is a 210-degree tilt to the side, along with either an angled rotation, or level turn range of 360 degrees. The PanaVise 209 vacuum base PV Jr. also allows for an added 140 degrees of movement via an adjustment knob at its base. This adjustment utilizes positive indents to prevent \"flopping,\" and locks the arm firmly into place while working on items. The combined range of mobility allows a user to rearrange a work item into virtually any position, and eliminates the need to adjust the overall position of the work station.', 'All PanaVise products are warranted against defective materials and/or workmanship to all original consumer owners from the date of original consumer purchase for the lifetime of ownership by the original consumer owner.

The standard method for programming the ATTiny ICs involves a breadboard, lots of jumper wires and a hardware programmer, but David Mellis over at MIT Media Lab has simplified the process by laying out this handy USB programmer.', 'The Tiny AVR Programmer plugs directly into your USB port and provides a programming socket for the ATTiny45 and 85. Just slot an ATTiny into the socket, plug the programmer into your USB port and start up the Arduino IDE. After installing the proper board definitions, you simply program it the same way you would any other Arduino board. The programmer even breaks out the IC pins to female headers so you can easily prototype around the ATTiny without pulling and plugging it over and over. The ISP header is also broken out so you can use the programmer for other AVR microcontrollers!', \"Note: You'll need to install the USBTinyISP drivers if you don't have them yet, you can find them in the documents below!\"]",

Acrylic is shatter resistant, weighs less than glass, and reflects a clear, bright image. The mirror comes with a swivel mounting bracket that makes it adjustable to a wide range of angles. The 18\" diameter size is suitable for areas up to 15\\' away from the mirror (diameter is measured from the outside of the 3/4\" rim). This mirror has a tempered hardboard backing for good strength-to-weight ratio in indoor applications. Tempered hardboard is a high-density fiberboard that has been coated with linseed oil and then baked to increase its water resistance, rigidity, and tensile strength.', \"Safety mirrors are used to help increase visibility in a variety of locations; for example, in hallway intersections and sharp turns, and in driveways and loading docks where drivers have to back up or enter traffic. Safety mirrors are sometimes called security mirrors, and they can be used to extend the view of security personnel, or to help monitor factory workers and automated processes to improve quality control and productivity. For convex mirrors, objects will appear to be further away than they are, and will be easier to see in a larger mirror. Depending on visibility conditions and the viewer's eyesight, objects will usually be recognizable within about 1 ft. of distance (including distance from eye to mirror, and from mirror to object) for each inch in mirror diameter.\", 'See All Industries manufactures safety and security mirrors.

Fluorocarbon O-rings provide higher temperature and chemical resistance. It has female National Pipe Taper (NPT) threads on one end and male NPT threads on the other for connecting a male and a female threaded pipe. The NPT threads create a tighter seal than straight threads. The maximum pressure rating is 250 pounds per square inch (psi), and the maximum temperature is 250 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'Check valves have two ports and restrict the flow of fluids and other loose materials through a pipe or passageway to one direction. Flow enters through one port and exits through the other, closing when flow reverses or stops. Two common types of check valves are ball cone valves and swing check valves. A ball cone valve utilizes a spring-loaded ball seated against a cone-shaped interior surface to stop the flow of fluid in a forward direction, and a swing check valve has a movable disc on a hinge to block reverse flow. Check valves are rated by their cracking pressure (the minimum upstream pressure required for the valve to operate), and they are used in various water, gas, air, and steam lines.', 'Control Devices manufactures specialty valves, nozzles, and condensate traps.

Separate clocks are provided for both the shift and storage register. The shift register has a direct overriding clear (SRCLR) input, serial (SER) input, and serial outputs for cascading. When the output enable (OE) input is high, the outputs are in the high impedance state. Both the shift register clock (SRCLK) and storage register clock (RCLK) are positive edge triggered. If both clocks are connected together, the shift register always is one clock pulse ahead of the storage register.']",

This mechanism creates a quick change in contact state when the trip point is reached. Reversing the motion of the actuator to a given reset point causes the contacts to snap back to their original position.Snap action contacts have different trip and reset points. The distance between the trip and reset point is called the travel to reset, hysteresis, or differential. Finite travel to reset helps to avoid multiple changes of state if the object actuating the switch is subject to vibration.Snap action contacts ensure repeatable performance in applications that involve low speed actuators. The amount of travel of the contacts is also not dependent on the amount of travel by the actuator. ']",

Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, Silver Gorilla Tape is the perfect duct tape for both indoor and outdoor use. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Weve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture. Make sure the surface is dry before you apply the tape, and were sure youll find this out for yourself. PRODUCT FEATURES: Double-Thick Adhesive: Grips smooth, rough and uneven surfaces. Tough, Reinforced Backing: The tight weave contributes to the heft, but Gorilla Tape can still be ripped by hand. Rugged, Weather-Resistant Shell: Withstands moisture, UV rays and temperature extremes. DIRECTIONS: Use like any other tape. Tear Silver Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Silver Gorilla Tape! Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Click on the Gorilla link at the top of this page to see more fine products from the Gorilla Glue Company.\"]",

A combination of characteristics including material, finish, construction, diameter, length, and breaking strength combines to give each rope its performance ability. Wire rope materials are selected for properties such as strength, elasticity, conductivity, and chemical- and weather-resistance. For strength purposes, most wire rope is made of bright (uncoated or bare) wire. However, it is also produced in a variety of finishes, such as polypropylene (PE), vinyl (PVC), or nylon. These coatings can increase overall durability and strength, and allow for specific use. The breaking strength for wire rope is the strength at which new wire rope will fail under a stationary load.

Frequently Asked Questions 1) Filament not extruding properly? A: Check the type of filament you're working with and set the proper extruder temperature based on the filament type and heated build Platform if applicable; trial and error. Rule of thumb is to set the extruder temperature to the highest temperature for the specific filament, then decrease the temperature by 5C until properly extruded. Please note this will vary with each 3D printer. 2) How do I store my filament? A: Most filaments tend to absorb moisture from the air; because of this your filament can become brittle and slowly degrade the quality. It's recommended to keep unused filament and store it in a storage container or zip lock bag with a desiccant. 3) Is your filament tangled? A: Check that the spool is spinning smoothly on the mount. 4) Is the nozzle clogged? A: Run the Load script from the onboard menus. Observe the Plastic as it emerges from the nozzle. Does it drop straight down, or curl up toward the extruder? If it curls back up toward the extruder, the nozzle may be partially clogged.\"]",

In the time-delay or monostable mode of operation, the timed interval is controlled by a single external resistor and capacitor network. In the astable mode of operation, the frequency and duty cycle can be controlled independently with two external resistors and a single external capacitor.The threshold and trigger levels normally are two-thirds and one-third, respectively, of VCC. These levels can be altered by use of the control-voltage terminal. When the trigger input falls below the trigger level, the flip-flop is set, and the output goes high. If the trigger input is above the trigger level and the threshold input is above the threshold level, the flip-flop is reset and the output is low. The reset (RESET) input can override all other inputs and can be used to initiate a new timing cycle. When RESET goes low, the flip-flop is reset, and the output goes low. When the output is low, a low-impedance path is provided between discharge (DISCH) and ground.The output circuit is capable of sinking or sourcing current up to 200 mA.

The tubing has been hot rolled, a method of compressing metal between two rollers at a temperature above the materials recrystallization temperature to attain the specified dimensions.', 'Steel is an iron alloy with carbon and other elements that modify the steel to achieve specific properties. In general, steels with higher carbon content have greater strength, hardness, and wear resistance, while those with lower carbon content have more formability, weldability, and toughness. Carbon steels, which include most AISI-SAE grades in the 1000 range, are classified by their level of carbon content as low (below 0.3%), medium (0.3% to 0.6%) and high (0.6% and above). Alloy steels, which include AISI-SAE grades in the 1300 and 4000 ranges and above, incorporate elements such as chromium, molybdenum, and nickel to modify properties like machinability and corrosion resistance. Tool steels, which include most grades with a letter and number grade designation, have high carbide content for wear resistance, high hardness, and the ability to hold a cutting edge. Some tool steels are designed to resist deformation when used in elevated temperatures.', \"Tensile strength, used to indicate a materials overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Formability indicates how easily the material can be permanently shaped. Machinability describes how easily it can be cut, shaped, finished, or otherwise machined, while weldability characterizes the ability to be welded.\"]",

The oscilloscope has an external channel that can trigger from a third source while acquiring data from channels 1 and 2. Edge and video triggers allow isolation of specific signals and a trigger hold-off function stabilizes triggering on complex waveforms. Add and subtract math functions plus FFT (fast Fourier transform) along with automatic measurements such as period, frequency, and peak-to-peak enable an in-depth analysis of waveforms. An auto-scale function selects the optimal settings for displaying a waveform, and can be disabled for educational exercises. Up to four waveforms can be stored in the internal memory. The unit has a USB port for connecting to a PC and includes Microsoft Windows compatible software for transmitting data and remote operation. Additional specifications include a rise time of 14.0ns and various triggering features. The oscilloscope has an 8\" color TFT (thin film transistor) LCD with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels for viewing waveforms. It has European Conformity (CE) marking. It comes with two passive voltage probes; CD-ROM PC software; a USB interface cable; a power cord for 100 to 240VAC, 50/60Hz, CAT II; and instructions.', 'H is height, the vertical distance from the lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.', 'Oscilloscopes are electrical testing devices used to verify the functionality of equipment that generates an electrical signal. Oscilloscopes measure the voltage of an electrical signal over time, and display the measurement as a waveform in a visual graph. The waveform shows the sweeps (or refresh) of voltage on a vertical (Y) axis, and the time on a horizontal (X) axis. Details of a waveform demonstrate the signal over time. Most oscilloscopes have two or four channels for inputting a signal. Some digital oscilloscopes offer more than four channels, allowing channels to be dedicated to specific signals and applications. Bandwidth is the maximum frequency of a signal that an oscilloscope can capture. A constant image will display if a signal is shown at a high frequency. Oscilloscopes may be analog, digital, or mixed signal. An analog oscilloscope directly displays an input signal as a continuous waveform, typically in a luminous phosphor on a cathode ray tube (CRT). A digital oscilloscope converts the input signal into a digital format and reassembles the waveform for display, typically on an LCD. A mixed signal oscilloscope (MSO) displays both analog and digital formats. Some oscilloscopes can display more than one channel and type of measurement simultaneously. Some oscilloscopes can capture waveform signals to memory, and recall them. They may provide real-time intensity grading, and may have the ability to adjust frequency of display. Oscilloscopes can be powered with batteries or electricity, or may have a built-in generator. They are commonly used for testing, measuring, and inspecting in science, engineering, telecommunications, automotive, and electronics applications.', 'Fujian Lilliput Optoelectronics Technology manufactures electronic equipment such as LCD monitors, navigation systems, and oscilloscopes under the brands Owon and Lilliput.

The heat-shrinkable outer wall is selectively cross-linked, while maintaining the high flow and excellent adhesion of the inner sealant liner. When heated in excess of 121 deg C (250 deg F), the tubing rapidly shrinks to a skintight fit, forcing the melted adhesive lining to flow and cover the substrate. The adhesive forms a flexible bond with a wide variety of rubbers, plastics and metals. Upon cooling, the adhesive solidifies, forming a permanent, non-drying, flexible and water resistant barrier. Adhesive reflow will occur at temperatures above 80 deg C (176 deg F).']",

It has a a maximum operating pressure of 150 pounds per square inch (psi), and two 1\"\" female slip connections, which must be fastened with glue. This ball valve is suitable for residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural use in a wide range of applications. Ball valves use a spherical disc to control the flow between pipes, tubes, or hoses. Flow is allowed when the hole that pierces the ball-shaped disc is in line with the inlet and outlet of the valve and is blocked when the ball is horizontally swiveled 90 degrees, so that the hole of the ball is perpendicular to the opening of the valve. Ball valves can be referred to as full port or reduced port (also known as regular or standard port) depending on the inner diameter or the valve. A ball valve is full port if the hole of the ball is the same size as the inner diameter of the connecting pipeline (resulting in lower friction) and termed reduced port if the hole of the valve is one pipe size smaller than the pipe, resulting in less flow through the valve than through the shaft of the pipe. Ball valves may have a handle or lever that aligns with the balls position (open or closed) for manual operation. They are primarily used in air, gas, liquid, and steam applications. Valterra Products manufactures and distributes valves, hoses, sewer systems, and pool and spa products. The company, founded in 1981, is headquartered in Mission Hills, CA.\"']",

It can also be found in the ingredients list of many dried fruit products. In addition, herbal dietary supplement products generally contain potassium sorbate, which acts to prevent mold and microbes and to increase shelf life, and is used in quantities at which there are no known adverse health effects. Labeling of this preservative reads as \"potassium sorbate\" on the ingredient statement. Also, it is used in many personal care products to inhibit the development of microorganisms for shelf stability. Some manufacturers are using this preservative as a replacement for parabens. Also known affectionately as \"wine stabilizer\", potassium sorbate produces sorbic acid when added to wine. It serves two purposes. When active fermentation has ceased and the wine is racked for the final time after clearing, potassium sorbate will render any surviving yeast incapable of multiplying. Yeast living at that moment can continue fermenting any residual sugar into CO2 and alcohol, but when they die no new yeast will be present to cause future fermentation. When a wine is sweetened before bottling, potassium sorbate is used to prevent refermentation when used in conjunction with sodium metabisulfite. It is primarily used with sweet wines, sparkling wines, and some hard ciders but may be added to table wines which exhibit difficulty in maintaining clarity after fining. Potassium sorbate is the most widely used preservative in the world. It is effective up to pH 6.5. The effectiveness increases as the pH decreases. Potassium sorbate has 74% of the antimicrobial activity of the sorbic acid. It is very effective against yeasts, molds, and select bacteria, and is widely used at 0.025 to 0.10 % levels in many food and beverage products as well as personal care products like lotions and creams.']",

The valve body is made of brass for corrosion resistance, ductility at high temperatures, and low magnetic permeability. Brass can be connected to copper, brass, plastic, aluminum, and welded steel. Fluorocarbon O-rings provide higher temperature and chemical resistance. It has female National Pipe Taper (NPT) threads on one end and male NPT threads on the other for connecting a male and a female threaded pipe. The NPT threads create a tighter seal than straight threads. The maximum pressure rating is 250 pounds per square inch (psi), and the maximum temperature is 250 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'Check valves have two ports and restrict the flow of fluids and other loose materials through a pipe or passageway to one direction. Flow enters through one port and exits through the other, closing when flow reverses or stops. Two common types of check valves are ball cone valves and swing check valves. A ball cone valve utilizes a spring-loaded ball seated against a cone-shaped interior surface to stop the flow of fluid in a forward direction, and a swing check valve has a movable disc on a hinge to block reverse flow. Check valves are rated by their cracking pressure (the minimum upstream pressure required for the valve to operate), and they are used in various water, gas, air, and steam lines.', 'Control Devices manufactures specialty valves, nozzles, and condensate traps. The company, founded in 1963 and headquartered in Fenton, MI, meets ASME standards.']",

Frequently Asked Questions 1) Filament not extruding properly? A: Check the type of filament you're working with and set the proper extruder temperature based on the filament type and heated build Platform if applicable; trial and error. Rule of thumb is to set the extruder temperature to the highest temperature for the specific filament, then decrease the temperature by 5C until properly extruded. Please note this will vary with each 3D printer. 2) How do I store my filament? A: Most filaments tend to absorb moisture from the air; because of this your filament can become brittle and slowly degrade the quality. It's recommended to keep unused filament and store it in a storage container or zip lock bag with a desiccant. 3) Is your filament tangled? A: Check that the spool is spinning smoothly on the mount. 4) Is the nozzle clogged? A: Run the Load script from the onboard menus. Observe the Plastic as it emerges from the nozzle. Does it drop straight down, or curl up toward the extruder? If it curls back up toward the extruder, the nozzle may be partially clogged.\"]",

The dimensions of this bearing make it suitable for use in skateboards, inline skates, and scooters, among others. Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan.

In order to make our material as user (and child) friendly as possible, the base material, PLA, is made from non-toxic renewable resources, including corn starch. PLA is biodegradable and therefore more environmentally friendly than other materials such as ABS (which is petrochemical-based). Further, using PLA allows users to avoid the fumes inherent in printing with ABS. The filament itself comes in four different colors, all which glow to bright neon colors when the lights are out. Not just for making childrens toys, our filament has serious applications for budding artists and makers who are looking to bring a new dimension to their prints. Useful projects include glow-in-the-dark light switches (to make it easier to find the switch after shutting off the lights) and for designing light-shades which continue to glow after the light is turned off, allowing children to make an easy transition to sleeping without a nightlight.']",

It is therefore dry molded or extruded in hydraulic extruders with (paste extrusion) or without (ram extrusion) lubricants. Paste extrusion of PTFE yields a flexible tubing. However, it occurs in a batch process and thus long continuous lengths are limited to the batch size, unlike the melt processible fluoropolymers - FEP, PFA and ETFE. The unique properties of PTFE cover an impressive range - high use temperature compared to other polymers, almost universal chemical resistance, excellent electrical properties at high voltage and high signal frequencies, non-stick characteristics, usefulness under extreme low temperatures (cryogenic conditions), UV resistance. However, mechanical strength and wear resistance are not criteria for which PTFE is recommended - which is one reason for the development of FEP, PFA and ETFE.', 'Manufactured by Fluorotherm in the USA, it is semi-transparent in color and FDA approved.']",

It is professional to enable you to see your thoughts and concepts engineered into a real and rewarding reality. * This filament is always round, with no oily residue, no air bubbles, and it comes loaded on a quality spool. * The quality of the filament is of great quality, and no kinks or breaks. Best choice for perfect printing! Features: * Widely used in health care, education, toys, building, automobile, electronics, anime field, etc. * For common 3D printers such as RepRap, Flash Forge, Makarov, AFINIA, Sol doodle 2, PRINTRBOT LC, Maker Gear M2, UP! and more. Frequently Asked Questions 1) Filament not extruding properly? A: Check the type of filament you're working with and set the proper extruder temperature based on the filament type and heated build Platform if applicable; trial and error. Rule of thumb is to set the extruder temperature to the highest temperature for the specific filament, then decrease the temperature by 5C until properly extruded. Please note this will vary with each 3D printer. 2) How do I store my filament? A: Most filaments tend to absorb moisture from the air; because of this your filament can become brittle and slowly degrade the quality. It's recommended to keep unused filament and store it in a storage container or zip lock bag with a desiccant. 3) Is your filament tangled? A: Check that the spool is spinning smoothly on the mount. 4) Is the nozzle clogged? A: Run the Load script from the onboard menus. Observe the Plastic as it emerges from the nozzle. Does it drop straight down, or curl up toward the extruder? If it curls back up toward the extruder, the nozzle may be partially clogged.\"]",

There are no air bubbles or oily residues. Every filament comes loaded on a durable, hard plastic spool, not a cheap, flimsy cardboard spool.ABS, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, is a favorite filament among 3D printer users because it is light weight and durable. It can be injection molded which makes it perfect for 3D printing extruders. It has a high glass transition temperature to reduce deformation, but it is also low enough to be safely attainable with standard 3D printers. ABS is a hard strong plastic with some flexibility when compared to PLA. It is also soluble in Acetone, and it can be easily sanded and machined.Compatible with RepRap, Makerbot, UP!, Lulzbot, Afinia, Solidoodle, MakerGear, Printrbot LC, and more!FAQ?Is the spindle hole large enough to fit my Makerbot printer?Yes! Our spindle holes are large enough to fit the Makerbot printers. You don't have to worry about fabricating a spindle extension any longer. *NOTE, these spools will not fit inside of the new Makerbot 5th generation printer drawers. You can still use these spools and feed the filament directly through the top of the printer.What other colors are available?ABS comes in a variety of different vibrant colors, 30 different options total.*New fluorescent colors are available. They glow under UV light, commonly known as black light.*New color changing filaments are available; the filaments will change colors at 31C (88F). The filament is one color below 31C, and when it is heated above 31C, the filament will change to another color.*New conductive ABS filament available. The conductive black ABS filament is exactly what the name implies. The conductive filament can be used for anti-static, static dissipative, and conduction of electric current.\"]",

Frequently Asked Questions:1) Filament not extruding properly? A: Check the type of filament you're working with and set the proper extruder temperature based on the filament type and heated build Platform if applicable; trial and error. Rule of thumb is to set the extruder temperature to the highest temperature for the specific filament, then decrease the temperature by 5C until properly extruded. Please note this will vary with each 3D printer. 2) How do I store my filament? A: Most filaments tend to absorb moisture from the air; because of this your filament can become brittle and slowly degrade the quality. It's recommended to keep unused filament and store it in a storage container or zip lock bag with a desiccant. 3) Is your filament tangled? A: Check that the spool is spinning smoothly on the mount.\"]",

It can be injection molded which makes it perfect for 3D printing extruders. It has a high glass transition temperature to reduce deformation, but it is also low enough to be safely attainable with standard 3D printers. ABS is a hard strong plastic with some flexibility when compared to PLA. It is also soluble in Acetone, and it can be easily sanded and machined. Compatible with RepRap, Makerbot, UP!, Lulzbot, Afinia, Solidoodle, MakerGear, Printrbot LC, and more! FAQ? Is the spindle hole large enough to fit my Makerbot printer? Yes! Our spindle holes are large enough to fit the Makerbot printers. You don't have to worry about fabricating a spindle extension any longer. *NOTE, these spools will not fit inside of the new Makerbot 5th generation printer drawers. You can still use these spools and feed the filament directly through the top of the printer. What other colors are available? ABS comes in a variety of different vibrant colors, 30 different options total. *New fluorescent colors are available. They glow under UV light, commonly known as black light. *New color changing filaments are available; the filaments will change colors at 31C (88F). The filament is one color below 31C, and when it is heated above 31C, the filament will change to another color. *New conductive ABS filament available. The conductive black ABS filament is exactly what the name implies. The conductive filament can be used for anti-static, static dissipative, and conduction of electric current.\"]",

This new model introduces new features including Audible Alerts and enhanced measurement range. Every measurement of ESR will be shown on the display as usual of course, but the unit will also produce a variety of tones depending on the value of ESR. And the tones themselves are surprising pleasant, including Bell-like pings (a couple of different types for ESR that is below certain values), and also a Beep-Barp type tone for ESR that is likely to be too high. There is also a reassuring Blip when the measurement has started and completed. The ESR measurement range has also been enhanced, now doubled, measuring from 0 to 40 ohms with a resolution as low as 0.01 ohms. This remarkably fine resolution is great for assessing large capacitors and even allows you to use the Atlas ESR+ for tracing short-circuits and finding the precise area of a PCB that has that invisible wisp of solder. Measuring a capacitor's ESR (equivalent series resistance) is a great indicator of capacitor condition. The Atlas ESR PLUS offers instant results, if the instrument is switched on then just connect the probes to your capacitor and the analysis starts automatically. You can even use the Atlas ESR PLUS in-circuit, saving you the trouble of removing capacitors. When testing capacitors out-of-circuit, the unit will also display the capacitance.\"]",

    "description": "[\"Proto-pasta magnetic iron PLA responds to magnets and behaves similarly to pure iron, even to the point of rusting in the right environment! magnets stick to this material like they would to iron or steel; it is not a magnet itself and will not stick to other metal. Magnetic iron prints beautifully with a matte Gray finish similar to cast metal. The density is about 50 percent higher than standard PLA giving printed parts a bit more heft and a less plastic feel. In filament form, FEPLA is slightly more brittle than standard PLA and requires extra care when handling. Processing is comparable to standard PLA. No heated bed required. Process may be less consistent on smaller nozzles and/or bowden-type machines. We frequently print using direct-drive systems with 0.4mm nozzles, though suggest 0.6mm and 190-210c (standard PLA or a bit cooler) for the best experience. This filament is more abrasive than standard PLA. Be prepared to replace your nozzle and do 1st layer adjustment. Try a wear resistant and/or larger diameter nozzle for increased service intervals.These 500G spools are shipped on the industry's only fully recyclable corrugated paper spools with no metal or plastic parts. These extremely high quality spools are rigid, lightweight, attractive, and eco-friendly. They also have a larger than normal inner core improving printability of the last few layers of Material, especially on 2.85mm diameters. The different designs on each spool are actual drawings, schematics, and Code from the equipment we manufacture your filament on. Enjoy! Contact Proto-pasta for more information.\"]",
